5.0,Positive,"It's not super powerful, but it helps if you only need a little bit of moisture or just a cool mist by your face once in a while. The lights are lovely, and doesn't make a peep. Well worth for a little mister."
5.0,Negative,"It worked great (for about 3 weeks) until the micro usb port broke off at the circuit board (which means there is no way to power this thing again unless you took it apart and solder the port connections back to the circuit board).  Sub-standard quality to say the least.**UPDATE** After seeing my review, the company contacted me to remedy the situation by either giving me a refund or sending me a new one.  I opted for a replacement, and they quickly sent me a new one which is working just fine now.  Because of their quick response and action, I changed my rating from 1 star to a 5--Great customer service!"
4.0,Positive,"I bought this because cold season is here and I wanted my daughter to have something to help her through. It‚Äôs really cute and small, which is nice! But it‚Äôs not super powerful. You also need to refill it pretty constantly. But for the price it does what it needs to do."
3.0,Negative,"I bought this thinking it would be perfect for work at my desk. But when I got it and opened it, right away it did not work. the port to charge it already had a sweet spot. The lights would blink for half a second while putting the charger in, then I couldn't get any indication that it was working while the charger was in the port. I tried different chargers i had in my house to see if it was just a wonky cord. After not getting it to charge, I asked for a replacement. Unfortunately the replacement did the exact same thing but this time didn't indicate any light power at all when plugging it in. :( I've scheduled to return both of them for the money back and ill have to invest in a better one"
5.0,Positive,"Perfect for a desk. Seems to be of good quality, would buy again."
5.0,Positive,"Pero despu√©s de un laaaargo uso puede fracasar, a√∫n as√≠ por el precio y facilidad para usar lo sigo comprando cuando truena, me gusta el tama√±o y el flujo del humidificador. Mi secreto para limpiar justo el metal es con un qtip en vinagre limpiar las sales acumuladas suavemente sin presionar mucho y ojo, voltear el filtro de algod√≥n a que est√© h√∫medo todo y te dar√° un flujo abundante de vapor."
2.0,Negative,This worked great when I first got it. Less than 6 months later it barely works and I can‚Äôt return it!!It turns off almost instantly and nothing comes out of it anymore. Horrible product. Do not buy it
5.0,Positive,"I bought two back in late January or February for my daughter and I.  I started having trouble with mine after I set it up.  I have to press really hard on the button.  If I move it, it turns off.Came back to write another review.  After writing my review customer service reached out to me and offered to send new humidifiers.  The new ones work great!  They are easy to start up and don't turn off when I move it around.  Customer service was great also and answered all of my questions.  Thank you!"
4.0,Positive,My son lives the little light and uses it as a nightlight. It works well for a compact humidifier but I wish it held. A bit more water so that it lasts the entire night
3.0,Positive,"Product worked fantastically for about 2 weeks. I bought this as a desk humidifier for my plants at work. I only ever leave it on the interval setting, so as to not rot my plants. The first 2 weeks the humidifier worked perfectly. Today I turned it on and the water vapor is no longer shooting up straight, it just falls over the device in a big cloud. When I first got it, you could audibly hear the humidifier running, even over music. I can no longer hear the humidifier.Should‚Äôve just spent the extra money on a better one upfront instead of rolling the dice."

So far I like it, it's pretty small for a nice room and a pink and it works what more can ask for lol"
4.0,Negative,Unfortunately this only lasted 3 months. It worked perfectly in my plant cabinet. I did all kinds of trouble shooting. Very sad this lil humidifier died. I really liked it. I even bought the 40 pack of filters.
4.0,Positive,Works good for car or very small areas. That‚Äôs about it. Love the light
4.0,Positive,"This is good but it's a lot smaller than I expected. Definitely recommend for car or small office only, I bought this for my bedroom and it's too small. The water evaporates very quickly. Shai wish there was a way to turn off the lights."
4.0,Positive,I really like how it lights up and the steam it puts out. Very cute.
4.0,Positive,I got this earlier this year to use in my home office in winter and it works great! I just wish it had the option of plugging in to the wall or a USB port. I‚Äôm out of ports and the cord is too short for the IS. To plug in to a wall outlet thingy.
3.0,Positive,This is cute and small and works okay but gets everything on my desk wet and runs out fast
5.0,Positive,I loved that it doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of space. It a great size for my son room. Very easy to set. Just add water turn on and it does its job.
5.0,Positive,üëç
4.0,Positive,"It works well, a bit smaller than expected but good for a small space like my dorm room and doesn‚Äôt take up much space on my desk. Its cute!"

Works well for a mini humidifier. I haven't had any issues with it. If you are in need of something for your desk or right next to you this will due. If you need to humidify a large area probably not."
3.0,Positive,"Has to be plugged in, and it makes an annoying noise"
5.0,Positive,"This humidifier for its compact size,  produces a good amount of moisture into the air for a bedside or a personal space. It was also a good size for traveling. I packed it in my carry on luggage and used it on my recent vacation."
5.0,Positive,This little guy is the perfect size for my desk. It is quiet. I love the color option and the fact that it will turn off after a while.
3.0,Positive,"Small so it doesn't hold a lot of water and only runs for a few hours but good for where I needed it (bedside table). Easy to fill. Doesn't make any noise at all. Downside... light on top is very bright, cord could be longer and there are no directions on cleaning or replacing filter"
3.0,Positive,Will last for maybe a few hrs
3.0,Positive,"After 3 or 4 uses, the rim of the top starts to melt. The light features are super cute but the quality of cute itself is not great."
3.0,Positive,"Works as advertised but I feel it releases too much moisture? I used it for about 3 hours on my work desk and noticed at the end of the afternoon that my desk was wet from all the water vapor. I‚Äôve used these types of humidifiers many times before and this is the first time I have had this issue. If you do not mind this, make sure to wipe your surface down every day after use."
4.0,Positive,As I do agree you really do get what you pay for. I‚Äôm changing my review due to the great customer service. The first one I had it for maybe 2 days and the plastic itself has melted. The button had melted into the body of it & it was unusable. I left my review and the company reached out and offered to send me a new one at no charge!! No issues with my new one so far so that‚Äôs great!
4.0,Positive,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Cute but very small"
3.0,Positive,Read all the info!! I didn't realize it was so small but still works pretty well it doesn't hold a lot of water and has to be refilled multiple times a day.
3.0,Positive,I bought my humidifier last year and it won‚Äôt spray mist this winter.  Bought new filters and cleaned with white vinegar but it won‚Äôt spray mist.  Light turns on but no spray.  Can‚Äôt find any info on how to fix.  Have to replace.  üò¢
5.0,Positive,Great sound for the size and price
5.0,Positive,Great item
4.0,Positive,It‚Äôs smaller than I thought but it does the job for my daughter and the lights are so cute!
5.0,Positive,So mine doesn‚Äôt light up but besides that I love it for my car. I feel like I never have to buy air freshener for my car ever again
5.0,Positive,"This product worked just fine. Was unsure after reading reviews, but I love it. You just have to know HOW to work it:3 second hold, turn on light3 second hold again, rainbow color1 second hold, turn on intermittent mist2 second hold, turn on continuous mostIt doesn‚Äôt last the whole night, but I keep a glass of water on my nightstand to refill. Very easy to use. Looks cute on nightstand or desk"
5.0,Positive,It‚Äôs a great product for such a small size. I would recommend it to anyone.
4.0,Positive,"It‚Äôs very cute and small, it isn‚Äôt too noisy and I noticed I don‚Äôt wake up with a raging allergy and dry sinus anymore!My only issue is that I notice it stops after couple hours. I turn it on (with full water) at around 12 am before I sleep and when I wake up at 7 am it‚Äôs turned off. I believe the straw that sits in the cup is slightly too short because there is still some water in the cup even after it stops. Would be amazing if you guys made the straw LONGER. Other than that I love it it‚Äôs cute it has cute lights."
4.0,Positive,"I like it, but there are a couple things I wish were different.1. There should be an option to turn it on without the timer eventually turning it off. The timer is great when I need it, but not so great when I want it to run longer than 2 hours2. I have a smart plug and I wish it would remember what mode it was in and I wouldn't need to push the button to turn it on after turning the plug on. Kind of defeats the purpose of turning it on with my phone if I have to walk to another room and push the button...3. I wish it didn't cool the water. I understand that it can't heat water, but if I put boiling hot water in it, hot steam should come outIt does work as intended and is very quiet."
4.0,Negative,I recently bought this to use in my Daughter‚Äôs hospital room bc she had surgery. It works good but I just thought you could charge it then use it unplugged but it has to stay plugged in to work.
5.0,Positive,Very affordable
5.0,Positive,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The air in my office building is awful in the winter between dryness and dust, so I got this little guy to help - very simple design, easy to use, and working great so far!  The lights are great but I have to keep them off because they distract me, haha.  Definitely recommend it for my fellow cubicle dwellers out there!"
3.0,Positive,"I filled it all the way up and put it to work in my baby's crib....but then it stopped running after 50 minutes or so. When I checked it, I realized that there was no water in there. So, I thought maybe I didn't fill it up full like I thought I had. So, I repeated the process....and this time it lasted a full hour. If this is something you need intermittently throughout the day and will shut it off and on, then sure this would be great. But, if you are planning to put it in a room or a crib to help your kids/baby sleep.....this is not the one you want unless you want to be getting up every hour on the hour to fill it back up again."
3.0,Negative,"The cord would not go all the way in, so it would not turn on. Had to purchase a new cord."
3.0,Neutral,"The media could not be loaded.
                



One week and the lights no longer come on. I don‚Äôt need them nor do I want them really,  but it‚Äôs pretty unacceptable that they quit this fast. Hope product lasts. The continuous stream is pretty quiet. The paused one is a little more annoying but I have it next to my desk, so it‚Äôs louder. Had next to bed and didn‚Äôt hear a thing sleeping. I don‚Äôt think it runs as long as it says but it‚Äôs fine for a small one to serve this purpose.  If I can fine another one I will try it and if not I will likely order this again as long as the price doesn‚Äôt increase.  Wouldn‚Äôt pay a penny more than the $12 I did.  Find it under that price and I would say its worth what we pay."
3.0,Positive,"it gets condensation all over my desk so I don't like using it, the rest of it is great"
2.0,Negative,This thing has burned through two micro usb cables since I got it. I am going to have to buy a new one
5.0,Positive,"Supposed to go for 6 hours, but stops when still half full.EDIT: When the vendor saw my review they reached out to me, and agreed it was a defective unit. They sent a new one out and it works fine. Wish more companies were as responsive.Changing my review from 3 to 5 stars for great customer service."
5.0,Positive,It quit working after a couple months of use. When it worked it was great but it was not reliable for long-term useEdit-they replaced the humidifier at no charge. I am thankful for the great customer service
4.0,Positive,Works great but doesn‚Äôt have a cube
3.0,Positive,"Stopped working after 3 months, lights up but nothing comes out."
2.0,Positive,DOesnt last long and is a challenge to figure out the setting
5.0,Positive,"I ordered this little cutie because air quality in my work space is so dry that I have a scratchy throat within an hour if arriving to work. This little humidifier is perfect for my small wirk space and air is cooler, more moist, and definitely easier on my throat. I definitely 100% recommend it for desk or bedside or beside your chair!"
5.0,Positive,"This humidifier is the cutest little thing. I was worried about the water capacity at first but if I fill it first thing in the morning it lasts me my entire 8-hour shift, almost exactly. The rainbow light is so fun, I love seeing people's reaction to it when they ask what it is, and when I tell them it's a humidifier they always say ""that's so cool!"" The HVAC system in my building has made my skin very dry and this has made a world of a difference, even after the first few days of using it. The pink color is also super cute and fits perfectly with the rest of my pink desk decor. I recommend this to people constantly. And the price can't be beat"
5.0,Positive,"I purchased this on Feb 2023 and I have mostly used during the cold months(Feb-May, and it is on again). It works fine, I haven't had any problems at all. I think it is cute and it does not take too much of my desk space."
4.0,Positive,Totally worth less than $20! Just wish it had another setting other than constant or every 3 seconds
4.0,Positive,Used in the winter because of dry air still works following winter for the humidifier lights no longer work
5.0,Positive,Works amazing
5.0,Positive,For my grands stuffiness and it worked perfectly for them.
4.0,Positive,This works great in the car but the cord that came with it was defective. Luckily they sell usb chargers at dollar tree lol
3.0,Positive,"I know it doesn‚Äôt hold a lot of water but still it runs out only after a few hours before you have to refill it again. I more so think it‚Äôs because it does produce a lot of humidity at once and just runs through the water quicker. It‚Äôs not noisy, but the cord is touchy. Also, it comes with a cord but not a box so make sure you have an extra usb box. Not my favorite, but it does what it‚Äôs supposed to do. I bought two different humidifiers to try for my plants in my glass cabinet and i like the other one I got better."
4.0,Positive,Only had 1 extra filter. On iTunes they had ten filters. Where‚Äôs my other eight. Other than that it works good
2.0,Positive,I left it on and the water inside melted the cup like material wasn‚Äôt made for water
4.0,Positive,"The media could not be loaded.
                



It‚Äôs cute and adorable and very simple to put together and take apart.  It the feature that I was looking forward to the most the lighting up feature wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶. Very colorful.  I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say it might be a faulty wire.  But it didn‚Äôt light up.(Update). Tried to use it in pitch black room‚Ä¶ It lights up.  Not bright enough to use as a night light but it‚Äôs a nice mood light."
5.0,Negative,"Update**I was contacted by customer service and was sent a replacement. Which I greatly appreciate. This is now going on past 1 year and works still like it's new. I've had no issues with my replacement product. So glad customer service reached out to fix my issue. To me that trurly shows this company cares and is listening to their customers. I would buy from this company 1000% again!!At first I thought this was great little machine. But only a couple months later, & it's already BROKEN! I'm very disappointed & upset. never good to feel like you washed your money. The lights still work but no more mist coming out the top. now it's pointless.It is really a small machine . I Don't even no if it was really helping at all. And the room it was in is definitely a small room."
5.0,Positive,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The size is very perfect, also it can work the whole night. It‚Äôs comfortable"
2.0,Negative,"I bought this humidifier to place by a plant that needed high humidity to thrive. I leave the humidifier on the sporadic mist option for 3-5 hours per day, always making sure there is enough water. On the plus side, my plant is doing great but sometimes I am left with a giant mess to clean up. Not sure why or how, but sometimes the level of mist increases on its own and sputters water everywhere around the lid of the humidifier onto the surface the humidifier is on. It‚Äôs like if someone spilled half a cup of water within a 1 foot circle and walked away. I tried buying a mini wood stool for the humidifier so the water will only splash onto that (rather than my laminate shelf) but last night it soaked the entire stool and dripped off onto the shelf about 24x10 in size. I have had to clean up 3-4 water messes in the last couple months that got all over the shelf since using this humidifier and now plan to buy a different kind since it can cause a mess while unattended."
5.0,Positive,"I ordered this a little over a year ago. It worked very well, more precipitation than expected. I was nervous it stopped working, but you just have to let the filter soak for a while."
3.0,Negative,I bought this at the end of June 2023 and it doesn‚Äôt work anymore.
5.0,Positive,I love this little humidifier. The mist is strong and it does what is needed. Filling it up once lasts around 7 hours when I am at work using the continuous mist setting.
2.0,Positive,This worked well for a year and I liked it.  Now for it to work I have to hold the USB cord in place for it to work.  I'm guessing there is a connection somewhere in the cords that is loose.
4.0,Positive,"Brought it a year ago for my office, worked very well, only used 5 days a week, sometimes, it has completely stop working, cannot get it to mist at all, I done everything, nothing is making it mist. I love the size and it when it worked, it worked beautifully, but to die out after less than a year, is not good."
3.0,Positive,"I only used it for a short period of time. It only covered a little part of the room no big change until I added eucalyptus oil. Then I seen where this product is helpful, but just water does not make a different in room.Buy bigger for bigger room. Small humidifiers are convenient but does not get the job done."
4.0,Negative,It really doesn't do the job for my car
5.0,Positive,So durable and long lasting with cute colors!
2.0,Negative,On the lowest setting it doesn't have a fine enough mist and pools at the bottom.
4.0,Positive,I really appreciate this product!! It helps my health a great deal!!
4.0,Positive,"This is so cute and I keep it on my nightstand.  I like the multicolor lights.  I appreciate the option to not have lights and auto shutoff, so I can fall asleep - no worries."
2.0,Negative,Ordered the two pack. One of them doesn‚Äôt have a charger. I thought these were portable/ rechargeable. They have to be plugged in while in use.
3.0,Neutral,"I used this humidifier at least every other day multiple times per day. It was great and looked cute. Unfortunately it quit working entirely including the lights and humidifier after 4 months. I think it may have gotten too damp on the inside. I took it apart and didn't see anything wrong with it. I tried a different cable, but that didn't fix it. I attached some pictures of the inside just so you can see what it looks like. I didn't see anything obviously broken. I took the little plastic stickers off to unscrew the lid."
3.0,Positive,"I think my unit was used? Apon arrival the box was open. I thought no big deal as it was also packed in a larger box with a few other items I ordered. Pulled the unit out of it's box and the protective ""bag"" was shoved down in the bottom, odd but whatever things happen. The weirdest thing was when I went to fill it with water it was wet inside as with the wick. This makes me feel like it was used. For now it works fine no complaits the only real negative thing was it doesn't come with a power block. You just get the usb cable. This is something I might have missed while skimming the listing. Also not a hinge deal as I do have an extra one laying around. But for those who don't you will need to get one.Unit itself is easy to use, 2 misting modes as with 2 light modes. It's quiet and compact perfect for my desk."
5.0,Positive,Lots of colors and stems as it should
3.0,Positive,Too small
4.0,Positive,small and cute only good for aesthetics. Definitely recommend a bigger humidifier if you have a bigger room.
5.0,Positive,Nice little humidifier works very well and has an automatic shut off all good things about this item. Have nothing bad to say.
5.0,Neutral,"These little humidifiers work great for my intended use. I keep tropical houseplants that prefer higher humidity and these work great to increase the local humidity. I‚Äôve seen some reviews that mention these making a mess, and I‚Äôve only experienced that when I‚Äôve left it running unattended and don‚Äôt address any malfunctions in a timely fashion. If these spit large water droplets, there is likely excess water in the ‚Äúexhaust‚Äù hole. A quick dab with a cotton swab or paper towel seems to fix the problem immediately. You can‚Äôt expect something this affordable to be perfect, but I like it so much I have 3 and I‚Äôm about to buy 2 more."
5.0,Positive,"Received the product yesterday. It worked the whole night and there were no problems at all.I have allergic asthma and I was hoping that the humidifier would help at least a tiny bit. I was wrong. It helped A LOT! My nostrils are so happy with the humidity and I noticed a significant improvement in my sleep quality. I would definitely recommend this product.  It is cheap and convenient! And yes, you can switch off its lights completely. The sound does not bother me at all since it is like a white noise helping me focus/fall asleep easier."
5.0,Negative,"I purchased this because my little 8 month old cousin was sick, it was awesome. The amount of mist that came out was great, also the lights on it distracted him from the way he was feeling and he just wanted to touch it."
5.0,Positive,Sooo cute! Perfect for a night stand or desk. Love the color changing lights. I bought for my daughters room. She loves it & so do I ! I purchased one for me. Its gives you the option for it to come out fast or slow pump. I added oils to mine. Its tiny. It's cute.  Works great . Just take in consideration its size. Its for a small area. Personal space. But I can feel a difference in my dry nose. Buy it!
4.0,Positive,"Pros:The stream of humidity is strong, especially for the size.It's lightweight and small so fits easily on my desk.Easy to use and put together. Very intuitive.It's cute!Cons:It's almost too strong. The on options are ON and ON in bursts. The intermittent on is better, I think, but I would prefer a slightly less aggressive humidity stream next to my electronics.Because it's so powerful, the water runs out faster than others I've used.It's noisy."
5.0,Positive,This works great as a desktop humidifier.
4.0,Positive,"It works just like it says. I like the light setting. However, I have put it in my bedroom (which is small), and is definitely not enough for the room. It is definitely for a very small room."
5.0,Positive,I installed this in my car and my wife and I were doing a 3000 mile round trip to Texas. Usually I would be stopping at rest stops often to wash my eyes and nose because it gets so dry from the heater or AC  but last trip was so comfortable due to this humidifier. My wife did not fell her skin tightening up and her cough was visibly better. I have this on all the time now when I am driving. I highly recommend using filtered water to reduce any buildup
5.0,Positive,I honestly was not expecting this to work as great but when I received it I had to try it. I originally bought this for our newborn since I didn‚Äôt want something big and this is actually perfect. Especially to place on a nightstand or small table!! The colors are cute and I love how it has modes!!
5.0,Positive,Love the color and compact size. Works very well :)
2.0,Negative,It worked great for the first 5 days. I thought it was portable but needs to be plugged in to work. That was fine but it completely stopped working after 5 days. I tried everything to troubleshoot it. Very disappointing as it was a gift to my partner.
4.0,Positive,Bought this humidifier for my office because it was my first one and I didn't want to completely splurge if I wasn't using it.  But this humidifier for the price and size is really amazing!  It lasts about 6 hours on one water fill if you use the continuous but it last longer if you use the other setting.  I always keep my lights on on mine as well
2.0,Negative,"When this humidifer arrived at my house, I expected a decent size that at least will have a impact on me and my room. Not at all, if your looking forward to buying a humidifer for you room do not choose this one. Just because of its cute colors and its light noise. It makes absolutley no impact for an allergy or ""cleaner air"" do not wast your money on this."
2.0,Negative,"Don't purchase! Waste of grocery money. Very disappointed:( The reas I gave it 2 stars, is because the lights are neat."
