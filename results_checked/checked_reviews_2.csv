5.0,"I've been with Verizon for years and always bought new phones through Verizon. This is my first unlocked phone purchase. I'm on a Verizon Family Plan and the plan for all lines was upgraded to a 5G Unlimited Data plan not long after 5G went live. I stuck with my 4G-LTE Moto Z2 Play until now when I pulled the trigger on this Google Pixel 7 Pro (512GB). The phone arrived at my door delivered by Amazon Prime next day. After I first turned on and set up the new Pixel 7 Pro I turned it off then I took the SIM card out of my old beat up Verizon Moto Z2 Play and I dropped it into the SIM slot of my new Google Pixel 7 Pro phone, turned the phone back on, and voilà! The phone immediately connected to 4G-LTE initially and I got frowny face, but about 3 minutes later it automatically switched and connected to 5G with 5 bars and I got big smiley face. It's been a solid 5G connection ever since. It was just that easy-peazy for me. The phone is snappy and responsive. Phone calls are crystal clear and sound amazing. The screen resolution and picture is fantastic. Super HD quality when watching 1080P or 4K. The speakers of the phone on speaker-phone sound fantastic, and the speakers sound fantastic even when listening to music or watching a video. The volume goes up very loud and it still sounds very good with little to no volume distortion (depending on the source audio). Bluetooth devices are pairing perfectly and without issues. So far, all the features of the phone work great. Security seems tight and the facial recognition and fingerprints work flawlessly thus far. The camera takes extremely good photos and video and even in very low light they come out very good. I'm trying to think of negatives and I can't really come up with any right now—except maybe that there are a whole heckuva lot of settings of all kinds that you can adjust, which isn't really a negative at all, but it takes a long time to get it all dialed in on an unfamiliar phone. Security options are many which is a good thing. I'm very happy I pulled the trigger on this so far and I'm not quite sure what to make of the 'verified purchase' negative reviews because this Google Pixel 7 Pro rocks. I'll come back and change my rating if that changes.",Positive
5.0,"This is a great phone!Everything is super fast.  I have always used flagship android devices, and this is the first one in quite some time where there has been noticeably increased speed and performance from my previous phone.  The screen is super crisp, and I love the ""Night light"" mode that reduces blue light automatically after sunset.The camera is incredible!  The zoom allows you to take pictures more clear than 20/20 vision.  I can take a picture of a sign that is far enough away that I cannot read it on my own, but the 30x zoom can read it clearly.  The stabilization at high zoom is pretty impressive as well.  The photo editing features are great also, particularly the unblurring and magic eraser.My only complaint is the battery - the battery life is ok, I can generally get through a day without charging, but it takes a LONG time to charge.  Like 3-4 hours to go from 20% to 100% on a wireless charging pad.I highly recommend the Pixel 7 Pro, but would discourage ordering it from Amazon.  Amazon sent me the wrong color (exterior bag was labeled with correct color, box inside was different color).  This was annoying but normally would not be a big deal.  However, returning this device has been a nightmare, with incomplete instructions and unresponsive customer service.  For some reason they do not allow the normal drop off process, perhaps because of the battery.The instructions made it seem like UPS was just going to show up randomly and ask for the phone.  I have not been contacted by them at all, not sure what to do.",Positive
5.0,"Phone is basically brand new. Seemed like whoever bought the phone first just returned it within days. Phone was still on Android 13, literally NO signs of damage, so scratches on camera bar nor screen. Battery life is at 100% as well. Everything works as it should on a Pixel 7 pro. I've bought tech in used and refurbished condition, but never a smartphone so I was a bit nervous. Glad it turned out splendid",Positive
1.0,"I bought the Pixel 7 Pro 4 months ago (new... not used or from a 3rd party seller), and it has incrementally been causing me to regret buying it. Either I didn't do enough deep-dive research on this phone, or the hype that's been building with the Pixel brand of phones over the years has been fabricated. Either way... lesson learned.My issues with this phone have thus far been:1) No matter how much adjusting of the screen & display setting, the screen randomly-to-always responds to finger and/or other pressure sensing to cause the screen to light up. Even in my shirt pocket it will randomly ""activate"", and by the time I have pulled it out, the phone has various apps opened. For transparency, I'm one who prefers to not have a screen lock, therefore I shouldn't have to have one set just to prevent what I just mentioned from happening. Screen lock is supposed to be for security reason... not because the device is glitchy and whatnot.2) More times than not, when I plug the phone up to a proper charging cable & adapter, or better, it will ding and screen light up every few seconds indicating it's charging like when it is first connected to the charger. Seems like it isn't charging correctly or there's a malfunction in the phone's circuitry. I have tried numerous chargers & cables... same thing. But it isn't every single time... just most of the time.3) Many times when I am ready to close an app, I have to tap on the bottom screen controls numerous times until it finally responds and does what it's supposed to do. And I do not use a screen protecting cover... just a case enclosure to protect the body and to keep the phone feeling like a wet bar of soap slipping from my hand when holding it.4) Installing the monthly security updates takes freaking forever! A 40MB - 500MB update should not take very long to install on a current model flagship spec'd phone. It takes so long that the screen timeout feature set to longest possible of 30-minutes (which is absurd that one can't have the option to choose longer like the good ole days). Once the screen times out, the update is paused until you turn the screen back on, which in turn causes the update process to assume you're using your phone and states that the update can't proceed while the phone is in use. You'd think telling the update process to resume would just pick up where it left off and maybe hopefully finish, right?... Nope! It starts all over again! The only way I can get the monthly update to install is to stay in front of my phone to keep an eye on it and to press the Volume up or down button every so often to prevent the screen from timing out and to not accidentally ""use"" my phone by tapping on the screen or whatever else. It generally takes 1-2 hours to install the update, which is ridiculous! The download part happens smooth & quick, so it's not a Wi-Fi or using cellular connection scenario... it's the installation part.EDIT to #4... God forbid any app on your phone throws up just a simple notification at the top. For instance, today April 10th 2023 while trying to get the 40.97 MB monthly update to install, after an hour went by and it was (is) still installing, my Amazon app had a notification come through, without popping up over the update process mind you... just the icon in the upper left corner, the daggum install process ""paused"" claiming it can't process the update while the phone is in use. WHAT?!?! So tell me, Google... are your customers expected to have to turn off any & all app background operations, disable all possible notifications/reminders/alerts/etc., text everyone we know to not to attempt to contact you in any way prior to trying to install a month 40 MEGABYTE file that takes 1-2 hours to install?... and every month at that?5) Bluetooth connectivity... over the past month or so, the Bluetooth will be a 50/50 if it'll connect to any of my Bluetooth devices when it never had a problem before. Even removing & repairing the devices doesn't fix it. I have to try & try many times most of the time now for the phone to connect and stay connected to the devices. Even power cycling the phone (rebooting) doesn't help.6) Also, over the past couple of months I have noticed that when I video call with someone, it has been getting worse on the battery during those times. What I mean is, when plugging the phone in to recharge while still using the phone. It used to recharge, albeit slowly, while I would be videoing with another, but now it will either just remain at the battery level its at when plugging it in, or even still drop a % or two. Even my older phones still re-charge while in video call use. Understandable that the re-charge would be slower due to device usage of video calling, but now being stagnate or even still discharging?7) And now, the phone has begun to overheat rapidly when using the phone since the March 2023 security Update. More so when video calling to the point where the phone cuts off... even with the case removed. It'll be so hot I can't even hold the phone until it cools off. I have ruled out the Messenger & Skype apps being the issue since I have other Android phones with the latest app version updates of those, and no battery re-charge drain or overheating issues with those. But it'll also overheat when using other non-video or intense processing apps too in a short amount of time when it never did before. And I always clear out background running apps when I'm done using them every time... so that's not the issue either.What makes this even more astonishingly absurd to me is, Android is a Google OS software and the Pixel line of phones are a Google hardware product... but yet the Android driven Pixel phones are the ones who seem to be arguably suffering the worst in many critical areas. It's almost as if they want to punish customers who chose to pay them money instead of going to a competitor. I'm beginning to think Google is now being ran & operated by BARD.The rest of my complaints are more or less personal nit-picks like... can't remove the date & weather nor the Google search at the bottom from the home screen, can't increase the screen timeout time longer than 30-minutes, no LED indicator when the screen is off if there are new notifications or if the battery is done charging, random out of the blue phone restarts for no rhyme or reason even when there is no updates... to name a few.Sadly, I can't return this purchase given that it's been over 30-days, and Google support is of no help either. So much for having a warranty when they won't honor it. I highly recommend staying away from Pixel phones.",Negative
4.0,"Previously used an iPhone. Could not justify the EXTREME price of a new iPhone. If you love your Samsung phone, well good for you. I hate them. Maybe a true believer will always pay too much for a phone, but the Pixel is a better value right now. I bought the Pixel also for the Camera, which I believe is currently the best available. (YMMV) Battery life is great so far. Display is very nice, and fast, but not something I can go, ""Ooh Wow"" about. Display just works. I have heard I can actually increase the resolution in settings, but it is OK as it is. This is the biggest, and possibly the heaviest, phone I ever owned. I wanted a big phone to make typing easier, and it works. If you check out the video reviews, you can see that real time voice recognition works flawlessly. I could probably do everything by voice command, almost exclusively, but so far, I am not really into that. Voice mails transcribe to text perfectly. Taking videos, works better than anything I have used before. I guess I only have one complaint: Compared to iOS, Android is a crude joke. With very rare exceptions iOS just works, intuitively. iOS is a polished piece of work. Android is getting better, but you would think by the time it got to version 13, it would also be a work of art. Perhaps there are too many fingers in the Android pie. Apps are generally adequate in selection, and function. As for Gmail App, I hated it years ago, and it has not gotten any better that I can see. Still will not search (has it, never works), still will not quickly and easily do bulk erasures. still has few sorting functions. As for all of the swipe gestures; they are abused. Put some convenient buttons on the screen as well, or instead. My favorite Android fault (that has never been totally addressed) is the craziest of all. Answering an incoming phone call. It is a PHONE people. Yes there may be 15 different ways to answer an incoming call, and that is the problem. The answer button can pop up several different places on the screen, or not pop up at all. I thought I was nuts, because sometimes it seemed like a call would come in, with NO WAY to answer it. I figured, ""Well idiot, you just need to take a 400 level course at some prestigious University to learn how to use your phone correctly."" So I asked both friends, and a few strangers, ""Do you ever get an incoming call on your Android phone, and have no way to answer the call?"" Strangely, THEY ALL SAID YES.This is however, a phone review, so yes, great phone. This is probably the the best value in top end Flagship phones. Consider the price, the features, the reliability, the durability, and customer support. You can pay more, but probably won't get much more. Exception may be if you want a folding phone, but really, what is that actually worth?  If you can stomach paying what they want for the Flagship iOS phone from Apple, those are really nice too. As for smartphone privacy, I can't stop laughing. The best thing about our smartphones collecting every detail possible about our location, movements, associations, heart rate, hours of sleep, automobile acceleration, searches, and conversations by and around us, is this: Because they can do it, I was not subjected to the humiliation of having a chip implanted into my body against my will. You know, just like they did with the SARS-CoV-2 (2019) mRNA vaccine. The fingerprint reader works for about one or two days, then you have to erase, and re-save, your finger print. I think that is because I actually use my hands for manual tasks, so the lines and cracks move about. Had exactly the same problem with my iPhone, but it was 6 years old. I was hoping for better on a new premium phone.",Positive
5.0,"""I don't write many reviews, especially on Amazon, and I was initially skeptical about this phone. However, after using it for 14 days and learning how to make smart changes, I truly love it. I can confidently say that it is the smartest smartphone so far this year for the price you are paying.You may be wondering what excites me about this phone. First of all, you should expect some bugs, but Google is good at fixing them. There are always new features being introduced, and with new features come new bugs. So, what do I love and dislike about this phone?One of the things I love is the incredibly accurate dictation through speech, even with my accent. I have used Samsung phones for several years, and while they have a much sharper and darker contrast ratio than other Android phones, their software experience is not as good as Google's. In my opinion, the Pixel 7 Pro is self-learning and adapts to you. It also emphasizes the most important features of a phone - the phone and texting functions - which is something I missed with all the extra features and bloatware on Samsung phones. For example, even after just 10 days of learning how to optimize this phone, I have never been happier with a phone and it is such a joy to take with me everywhere. I have been dictating texts with no errors so far.The only things I don't like about this phone are the not as sharp screen compared to Samsung, and the Bluetooth quality is not as good. However, if you use adaptive sound, it improves the Bluetooth quality through your headset. Despite these minor issues, the additional features and ongoing support from Google make this phone well worth the price I paid. I did purchase a Samsung Z Fold 4, but now I have to sell it because this phone is so much more intuitive.When you buy this phone, make sure to spend an hour learning how to use it and making important changes before deciding if it is right for you. If you are looking for a simple phone with amazing functionality at a basic level - just phone and text - this is, in my opinion, the the best choice.""",Positive
5.0,"I think I became Pixel fan. And will continue use Pixel phones. Phone is not ideal, finger print and face recognition are not working perfectly (But good). Found couple of minor bugs. And Battery life is not super long lasting (but is okay through 1 day)But I close my eyes on this things, cause phone feels SO GOOD, I LOVE IT. Camera is awesome, better then IPhones in my opinion. Phone is very comfortable to use.",Positive
5.0,"I have only truly loved one cell phone. That was my Samsung Galaxy S4. My Galaxy S1 was so cheap it didn't even have a flashlight. My S7 annoyed my so much I literally threw it out the window. I upgraded to the Pixel 3XL.That was a (mostly) good phone. From day 1, the internal GPS was messed up so it never told my Nest thermostat I was home, and the thermostat would always change to away mode while I was still in the house. Using store apps was also difficult as it would think I wasn't in Walmart, or Home Depot, and not allow me to search for items in the stores.C'est la vie, I lived with it for 4 years, until it's quirks and foibles had me to the point where I smacked it with my fist and cracked the screen. So much for Gorilla Glass. No bother, I scored the 7 Pro on sale.The 7 Pro keeps some great and useful features from the 3Xl, such as double tap the screen when it's off to bring up the lock screen. Love that. I'm a troglodyte and basically use my phone to talk, text, browse, and take the (very) occasional picture. I could easily get away with a midrange phone, but I like big screens, and fast processors. The sale price was a good deal, so I bought this.Features I love that were not on my 3XL; double tap the back to perform a preset command. You can use it to take a screenshot or pause the media you're playing, etc. Very handy! The lock screen gives the option to have the clock in one grid, as opposed to the 3XL, once it was updated to Android 10, wherein the clock was split into top and bottom for hours and minutes.The phone seems a good deal faster than the 3XL. The upgrade to Gorilla Glass Victus from GG5 should hopefully help prevent damage. I don't know whether it's the GGV, or the liquid glass I had applied to the screen for protection, but the glass attracts a lot of dust! I must clean it regularly. I also don't really care for the curved glass on the screen edges. I'm not really sure what the point of that is, but it can make reading text difficult, and it can cut off letters on the edges. It is a big phone, which is what I wanted, but it will be difficult to perform one-handed operations unless you have big hands like myself. Even then, it can be a chore. The one thing I don't like, is the sensitivity of the screen. Holding it one-handed, I use my thumb to scroll up and down. This will easily cause the screen to think you're long-pressing, and highlight the text to allow you to copy/paste/google search, etc. It's the single most annoying quirk I've discovered. I've tried adjusting the screen sensitivity level to no avail. My 3XL never did this, and the screen size is virtually identical to the 7 Pro. The only fix, is to adjust how I hold the phone so that my thumb is more perpendicular to the screen and not as much of my thumb is touching. This means that it's not as secure in my palm so I have to take great care not to drop it.Overall, I like this phone. Samsung has a lot going for it, but I'm happy with my purchase. It's also very easy to use and set up. While I'm certainly not a noob, I'm not as tech savvy as I could be. Yet, I had the phone up and running within an hour or so with all my configurations locked in, and adjusted. And no GPS issues either!",Positive
2.0,"To preface this review, I probably should never have bought this phone. After watching my partner suffer through numerous issues with her 6 Pro (3 hr screen-on time and BURNED cases being the slightly more egregious issues), I decided to give her my prized S22 Ultra. It has been years since I owned a Pixel, and I missed the stock Android interface anyway. Surely Google would have fixed the issues with the new 7 Pro... What could go wrong?Long story short... A lot.The Pixel 7 Pro is easily the worst flagship-grade phone I have ever personally owned. While not without its merits, I would advise anybody who is not a die-hard stock Android maniac or devout JPEG picture-taker to look elsewhere. Because my issues with this phone were so numerous, I will list them in bullet points so this review is not the length of a college thesis paper. I have received a replacement unit from Google in my time with this smartphone as well, and these issues were constant across both. Fool me twice...1.) HEAT. Jeez, does this thing get hot. On mobile data? Hot. Wifi? Hot. Doing absolutely nothing? Hot.This is thanks to the dumpster-grade Samsung modem that is the beating at the heart of this thing. I see a lot of reviews blaming the terrible thermal performance on the processor, but the real culprit behind the heating woes is the ramshackle modem that was probably cobbled together with what I'd suspect was 2 sticks and a quarter roll of aluminum foil.2.) BLUETOOTH AGONY. Want to use your bluetooth headset with your smartwatch connected? Google says ""Get bent,"" because headphone signal will randomly cut in/ out/ not connect at all. Think a full factory reset will help? Sweet summer child... I've tried it all! Different watch, different headphones, you name it. No dice.3.) As an extension of Point #1, 5G modem is a dog. This thing sucks. Seriously. Constant dropped signal in areas where reception is good/ great. This can be somewhat mitigated by switching to 4G only, but why must I disable features to get my phone to not drop mobile data? For comparison, my LG V60 from 2020 gets 5 'bars' of 5G connectivity where the Pixel would only have 2.4.) Random system lockups. Several times I have experienced hard crashes that required me to hold the power button for 30 seconds to force shutdown this phone. Not the biggest deal, but super irritating when I'm using my phone for work, only to be set back several minutes for a full restart.5.) Mediocre-bordering-on-bad telephoto camera. Not the biggest deal, but while still usable, compared to the 6 Pro's crisp and color-accurate 4x lens, the new 5x module is utter garbage: most images are a low-detail, hazy mess with a horrific yellow tinge reminiscent of the old telephoto lenses on the iPhone 8 Plus from... 2017. This behavior isn't always consistent, but there is certainly something very wrong with Google's white balance algorithm that they haven't bothered to fix. For reference, the last 2 photos were taken 20 minutes apart on the same day. The focusing distance is crazy bad as well, so forget using this for any macro shots.6.) Worse speakers when directly compared to the previous model. Not only are they worse, but they sound flat-out awful, with super tinny highs and overblown low end creating a uniquely terrible listening experience. This is fixable with a 3rd party app called Wavelet, but worth mentioning for those who use their phone a lot for media consumption.7.) Distracting scrolling jitter. I've never seen a 120hz phone completely free of some dropped frames, but the 7 Pro may have the worst case of jitter I've seen so far on a high refresh rate screen. Though this extends to the 6 Pro as well.Having said ALL that -as I mentioned before- there are still some upsides that keep me from hocking this Google-Samsung-made monstrosity straight into the dumpster where it probably belongs. Though the main reason is mostly that I don't want to drop $1,500 on a different flagship any sooner than I have to.1.) Camera quality. The Pixel still has my favorite (JPEG) image quality out of any phone on the main and ""2x"" lens. This thing is truly capable of (somewhat inconsistently) producing an absolutely incredible banger of a shot, even on the 5x/ 10x zoom crop. However... for you professionals and photo aficionados out there, despite what some outlets have reported, RAW quality is... bad.2.) Stock Android/ theming. The adaptive theming of the newer versions of Android understandably isn't everybody's cup of tea, but I unashamedly love it. The interface is my favorite across any manufacturer's OS to date.3.) The screen. While on paper it isn't as good as something like, say, the Galaxy flagships on a purely technical level, I much prefer the color tuning on the Google Pixel.4.) Battery life has significantly improved over the course of the phone's lifespan. I went from having it die right after a 9-10 hour workday, to usually lasting to bedtime (starting the day at 7AM to 1AM).So, that's it, folks. Ultimately I will not be recommending Pixels to anyone anymore, as I've done in the past. But if you are able to find one for a cheap price and are able to deal with all of the concessions, be my guest. It will still likely be better than most of the junky sub-$300 budget phones. Just don't say I didn't warn you.2/5Maybe 2.5-3 out of 5 if you can find it for below $500, but I still cannot recommend in good conscience.",Negative
1.0,"Although I happen to love this phone more than all the previous Galaxy phones. Less than 6 months with this phone the upper speaker started making distorted sounds and eventually quit working. Since it's only function is for calls and a few other sounds that you don't really notice missing until it has been diagnosed at the speaker is no longer working. I was wondering why my phone calls would end up hearing me but I could not hear them. For a while I thought I was in dead zones and I would end up having to call the people back. When the speaker finally gave up and months of troubleshooting with Google and YouTube and every other way to troubleshoot and all reboots over and over with this phone, it turned out the phone has a hardware problem. The upper speaker was no longer working. The only way I can take a phone call now is on speaker phone which uses the lower speaker and not very professional while doing business or when in the hospital which I happen to be in right now.  Google says if you purchase the phone on Amazon (who is not an authorized dealer for Google Pixel phones), they are responsible for the warranty. Good luck with Amazon's customer service who has wasted over 8 hours of my time on recorded lines. Telling them that this is a business line and it is a recorded line makes them disappear. Even asking for a manager you end up with just another rep pretending to be a manager and then put you on hold forever. They transfer you to other departments who say they have to transfer you again to other departments or put you on hold constantly so a new person picks up the phone and you have to start your call all over again. I have to take a 2 to 3 hour window to make this attempt with Amazon each time until I get so aggravated and need to move on with the rest of your day. My last attempt with Amazon's terrible customer service I was put on hold for 1:53 minutes. I just put the phone down while I was working to see if anybody would ever come back on the line and of course they never have. I took a screenshot of the amount of time I was on hold on a recorded line to add to my list of wasted efforts. Purchasing from Amazon has gone downhill over the years and a client like me buys 90% of their supplies and products on Amazon lose money. Going to UPS store to drop off bad products or in the past few years returned items that are not even what you ordered or missing parts is a regular weekly trip to UPS stores. The only thing Amazon used to have left was customer service. Amazon has officially lost control of the only thing they had. Even the LIE of next day delivery or two day delivery is gone. Why do I even pay to be a prime member anymore when items are advertised as next day or two days and change during a cash out if you're lucky to catch it. Sometimes I look on the app for a product and get a price then switch to Google Amazon bring up the identical product for much lesser price. Is all that time wasted trying to not get screwed on prices and returning products 50% of the time even worth it anymore with Amazon? I even noticed this year that several items that were returned with tracking number saying Amazon has accepted the return show on the website that I still need to print the label. After repeated attempts to get reimbursed with customer service reps acknowledging that they receive their products, Amazon has refused to reimburse me. While being left on hold for hours at a time I started going back through my history and notice this on multiple items. They have accepted back in their warehouse but website still says print label. I have the UPS tracking number that matches that label saying it has been accepted at the Amazon warehouse and still no refund no explanation just putting you on hold or transferring you. I now have to go back through the whole year to see how much Amazon has stolen from me. I have done better Business bureau complaints that shows they have accepted their product back but their website still says Print label. The only thing Amazon could say is that they want to see a government ID for suspicious activity? That's their answer on BBB but they don't tell you how to give them that government ID. They already send you an SMS message to accept them on my account and have made me confirm my address email etc. How would I be somebody perpetrating and trying to get a refund for the identity they think I just stole. There's no common sense at all with that and they have no problems allowing me to spend money for months without ever mentioning that they think they're suspicious behavior on the account. The only suspicious behavior is theirs and their lack of customer service. I have noticed that all the tracking that went to a certain Warehouse in Hebron KY was the comment denominator for non-refund. After being burned with a cell phone by Amazon they are just not worth doing business with anymore. They don't care about the imported garbage being sold with fabricated name brands with prices that change by the minutes. They don't care that they are hurting people's businesses losing time and money. One of my clients purchased plumbing for a bathroom remodel in 2023 and it was a disaster of opened used products missing parts, wrong sizes, showing up late. I had to rebuild their whole bathroom at my cost losing my first client in 30 years. The only thing Amazon did is offer me a $10 Amazon credit for the thousands of dollars I lost. I now I have to go buy $1,000 phone  with a more reputable company that will warranty the item if it fails instead of playing games putting you on hold or passing you off to the next customer service rep that will do everything but handle the issue. I'm sorry Amazon but you have lost control of customer service which was the only thing you had left. These past 2 months I have been in the hospital with several surgeries without a proper working cell phone thanks to Amazon who doesn't care about their loyal clients at all. They are more concerned about who's going to pay for the buy box on the sellers side. That's right Amazon will get you frustrated to the point of learning how they actually function and they are all about who is going to pay for the seller's buy box. They used to protect buyers in the past but they no longer protect even business accounts who need to make a living buying on this site. As soon as I can walk again Amazon has forced me to go back to stores where I will end up saving time and money. If anybody has read this far with this review look up Amazon complaints on better Business bureau. It may make you go back and look at your account after you figure out how to get through their accounting nightmare. If you can work spreadsheets it's the easiest way to figure it out.",Neutral
4.0,"I swear, for a premium phone, Google has the worst fingerprint sensor on Earth. If you don't put your finger dead bang on the sensor, it will not recognize you. If said finger is rotated even just a degree from the orientation in which you recorded your finger, it will not recognize you. This is ridiculous. You futz around making tiny adjustments in finger positioning until you hit 3 times and then have to log in with a code anyway. There is no reason that Google's software should not be able to make minor rotations or position adjustments to compare a finger to what is stored. That's what everyone else does. Aside from that, I don't really see anything wrong with this phone.",Negative
4.0,"One of the best smartphone camera systems on the market. Phone is fast and responsive. Has a bunch of features exclusive to Pixel phones. But there are a couple downfalls that prevent it from being perfect.Not much to say about the cameras except that they are awesome. Everyone already knows Pixels have some of the best cameras. I do like the automatic edits once you take a picture (it'll try to make the colors look natural). I've had several instances where it improved the look of the sky that was behind me. It's really great for landscape shots and has several modes for picture taking and video recording. Cameras are nice in low light. Nightscape mode will enhance the picture taken so that you get a clear picture.User experience has been really nice due to the clean android experience. I switched from the OnePlus 6T and everything still felt very intuitive. I did miss the notification bar but it was really easy to get used to Android 12. There are a lot of built in features with the Pixel that make it unique. Call filtering allows it to automatically screen calls. Direct my call converts speech to text and provides options when calling vendors/support. Hold for me detects hold music and waits on hold for you until someone is ready to speak. Phone also includes free access to Google VPN. There are a plethora of other features, but those are some that I found really handy.Battery life is not as terrible as some people have said. However, it's not great either. It feels standard to me. I will still need to charge at the end of each day. It's certainly not a 24 hour battery if you use your phone regularly. Charging speed is slow. There's no hiding it. You can turn off the adaptive charging, but it still takes too long to charge. OnePlus has some of the best charging speeds, but other phones have also been able to up their charging speeds as well. As a 2022 phone, I would've expected this to charge much faster.I've noticed some occasional strange performance issues that seem to stem from this phone. There have been multiple instances where the phone wouldn't connect to my car via usb. I would need to restart the phone to get it to work. Video recording will stop and not let you record if the temperature outside is too high. I've never had warning on any other phone. I've had an issue where I hear no audio on a phone call, but other party can hear my voice. This was fixed by restarting the phone. Some customers reported that the camera bump can easily get scratched. I have a pretty thick case so I haven't had any scratches. You can also get a skin to cover it.Price is higher than what you pay for. Sure it's cheaper than Samsung Galaxy. However, it also lacks a lot of the raw power Samsung has. You're mainly paying for the camera and the features you can only find on a Pixel device. Other than that, the specs aren't anything that you don't see in a phone nowadays. If I had not purchased this, I would've gone for the OnePlus 11 as it's at a much cheaper price point and has most of the things I want.Overall, happy with the phone. It's a nice upgrade from my old phone. I'm not looking for the cutting edge in terms of hardware because I don't primarily use this for gaming. I appreciate the Pixel exclusive features that actually add to the experience of using this phone. I just wish that some of those bugs get resolved.",Positive

5.0,"Any modern phone addresses my browsing, app, communication, and eMail needs.  But the Pixel 7 Pro's telephoto lens finally addresses the main shortcoming of phone cameras.  And, oh yeah, it's a nice phone.  The fingerprint sensor really is improved.",Positive

5.0,"Please read this.......Learned more than l wanted to ordering phones off Amazon as refurbished, prior owner....not brand new.Had a Google 6Pro and connected fine last year to my Crickett Wireless (Owned by(?) AT&T Network. I dropped the phone and the Special Screen cracked and would cost me with a professional repairs of $200-300.Decided to just get another phone off Amazon. So instead of getting another google l decided to get a Samsung and was an international model. Didn,t know international models can,t connect to Crickett. Had to return it to Amazon.After much research l decided on Google Pixel 7 Pro over 8 Pro cause a YouTuber who reviews cell phones said the 8 Pro over heats and looses cell signals, just stops working. Pictures are better but l need a functional phone. So l decided on a great quality picture phone, 7 Pro.In reviews of it l saw a review of the 7 Pro on Amazon. They said you need to get the USA model number GE2AE and the other model (same phone) was the international version which doesn,t connect to USA cell carrier's.I bought the model number GE2AE which is listed in ""Product details"".... under Feature & Specs there is an ""Item Details"" arrow. Click on it and the model number will be there. If you go on Crickett they sell for alot more money and list there own model number. Don,t worry its this same model GE2AE.I put my Crickett Wireless sim card in and no problems connecting to Cricketts AT&T Network.

4.0,"As much as I love the pure experience that you get from a Pixel device, the Pixel 6 Pro found itself in my sock drawer due to the really awful 5G reception I was getting on Verizon. Where my S22 Ultra would get 300 megabits down (sometimes more) in a C-Band area, the Pixel could barely squeeze out 100 megabits, with similar choking on the upstream.Well... I'm pleased to say that the updated modem in the Pixel 7 Pro is leaps and bounds better. So much so, that I don't notice any reception differences between it and my S22 Ultra.As for the rest of the phone, well, if you're coming from a Pixel 6 series, the differences are going to be much more incremental unless macro photography is your must-have (and to that end, it works beautifully, and is one area where the S22 Ultra and prior Pixels simply don't compare).Build is very, very similar to the 6 Pro. If you hold them side by side, the biggest difference you'll probably notice in the physical details is that the right buttons are shifted up a couple of millimeters. Juuuuust enough that you won't be able to use your 6 Pro case, unless it has a cutout on the side for buttons. The camera visor seems a little more pronounced to me, and the selfie dot seems to blend a bit better, but that could just be the improved display on the 7 Pro. The overall feel is fairly premium, though I think the display has a kind of plastic feel to it. The S22 series feels much more solid and utilitarian, but I'd argue less expensive.Surprisingly, you can notice the improvement in processor speed in several apps, not to mention just scrolling through settings. Again, using my S22 Ultra as a comparison, I can't say I've noticed a performance hit, even though the single core specs on the Snapdragon processor are better. Overall, I think it would be fair to say that the Pixel 7 Pro does all of the things the Pixel 6 Pro does, but faster and sometimes (like with Magic Eraser) better.At launch, there have been a lot of incentives on the Pixel 7 series that make upgrading less expensive -- potentially free, and if that's what you're weighing a purchase against, I'd say ""go for it"". But if you're looking at a difference of hundreds of dollars to go from a 6 to a 7, I'm not sure I'd recommend that unless you were experiencing the same modem issues that so many other owners had.",Positive
5.0,I have not used face recognition or fingerprint reader but this phone works great after 4 months--this is the second Google Pixel 7 Pro I have purchased and this one is different in the on/off category---hard to get use to,Positive

4.0,"It seems like everyone gave this phone the ""phone of the year"" honor.  I'm not sure why.  I used it for a while and then went back to my S22 Ultra.  Granted, each phone has it's issues, but S22 Ultra is works better.Works better?  Yes.  The Pixel 7 Pro has too many bugs.  The fingerprint reader, although they say it's better, doesn't work half the time.  I can't imagine how bad it was before.  Want to use Chrome to surf the web?  Sometimes it just refuses to load.  You have to jump through hoops to get it working.  Want to use face unlock for your banking apps, like on an iPhone - too bad.  It doesn't really work.  Want to use that camera they brag about?  It crashes more than a drunk, elderly, American driving in London.Want the latest updates on your unlocked, non-carrier locked phone?  Too bad, there is a good chance that won't happen, if you have certain carriers.  I'm not kidding.  Somehow your network restricts the updates you can get by MONTHS.  My S22 Ultra is more up to date than my Pixel.  That's just wrong.If you ignore the bugs, the raw android is mostly okay.  It is annoying that you can't add more than 4 quick apps to your home page.  I also wish you could organize your app tray, instead of having a big list.  Those are minor things though.  The thing that gets me the most is your short cuts.  The big bubbles seem awkward at times and having to double swipe to get to the settings shortcut is annoying.The hardware seems fast enough, but it did take nearly two hours to install a security update.  That seems excessive.  At least everything was done in the background until the reboot prompted.This phone weighs less than the S22 Ultra.  It's noticeable.  If you light a lighter weight phone, this is a better option.Now for the biggest plus for this phone - the price.  I got this phone in brand new condition for under $600.  That's a lot less than the S22 Ultra.  That brings the value you get to almost that of the S22 Ultra.  It's almost good enough to put up with the bugs.",Positive
4.0,"Battery life is fairly decent, touch sensitivity is fine, screen clarity is excellent, and the camera is great, but...I severely dislike the poorly considered curve-edged screen they put on the Google Pixel 7 Pro.The phone screen pokes out above the edges of the phone body, which makes the screen and screen protector more vulnerable to breakage. (Normally, I replace my screen protector about once a year, but I've already replaced 2 on this phone in the few months since I got it!) Also, manufacturers are having to design the Pixel 7 phone cases with slightly retracted sides so they won't displace a screen protector's curved edges, because that causes buckling and poor touchscreen sensitivity. Again, less protecton means more hazard and less protection for the screen.",Positive
4.0,"Great phone except for one thing the touchscreen is way to super sensitive, when scrolling it opens everything on news app with out me picking it, instead of letting me scroll down an pick what I want, I've reached and done every thing allowed in settings which basically nothing, this is the only issue and it is bad enough I am about ready to trade it for something else,Also the fingerprint  scanner is the absolute worst I have ever had, useless! But I have found most of them suck anyway. If it wasn't for those two things it would be a very strong 5 star phone.",Negative
3.0,"After trying five other phones, I was down to trying the Google Pixel 7 Pro with Android 13, 512GB storage and 8GB memory and I was disappointing once again with the blandness of the Android OS. The Google phone looks and feels like I am using an Iphone, everything looks like a baby drew it with crayons and the customization features are getting less and less with Android 13.Background services did work with video doorbell and WiFi Smoke detector apps.The Screen is nice and bright, however the screen has curved edges more mild than most other curved screens. Still though, why are manufactures building phones with curved screens???? Every so often there is something on the very edge of the screen and you can't tap it because of the curve of the screen. Useless feature.No customization for the Lock screen features, there is a search bar on the home screen that you can not remove and no more locking apps open in Android 13. The term Pinning apps  has changed from ""Locking"" them open to where they are always open even on a reboot, to pinning the app open full screen. The second option is STUPID and not necessary, but locking apps open and MORE than Six apps at a time is important to me. My Most used apps, I like to stay open the entire time, after restarting the phone, my apps are still open. I don't like having to look for the icon and open the app, just hit the recent app button and there are all the apps I use regularly. Just like my computer, I leave a lot of programs open and I expect them to stay open.Google advertising a 24 hour battery which tells me that they know their Processor sucks down too much power. The battery is a 5000mAh battery. This size battery in all other phones I've used will last nearly two days, however I did not keep the phone long enough for the ""Battery Optimization"" to kick in.The Cameras were very nice and typical for the price of the phone, they performed just shy of Samsung's S22. As one would expect from a Pixel phone, the cameras performed well with some cool editing features in the camera app. Unfortunately you are stuck with Google Photos app, a terrible pile of programming.Gone are the days of unique personality and style from each manufacture. Now all phones conform into the same bland and boring Android cookie cutter mold to where there is little to no difference in which phone you go with, the exception being the installed hardware. My LG V60 ThinQ made in 2020 with Android 10 has ten times the options and actually has personality, plus all the features that I dearly miss, like App Locking/Pinning, Slow Charge, Embedded Service apps (Keyboard, Phone, Contacts, Messages, Gallery, Files, Notes) that were secure and not tied to a big company, Full Home/Lock screen customization.Overall the Google Pixel 7 Pro is a great phone for the normal user, taking pictures and video for blogs and tictoc is just what this phone is made for. Surfing the web and checking email, maybe a video conference, all will work good on this phone, but keep a charger cable with you at all times.",Neutral
3.0,"Moving from an old iPhone to Android for various reasons. After lots of research and comparisons between Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy S23 Ultra, Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, I bought Pixel 7 Pro a week ago. Not a heavy phone user. Bought this knowing it's history of heating problems at the deal price of $700.It is just ok for me.  Major issues listed below:(1) the finger print sensor doesn't detect fingerprint 40% of the time. Have deleted and setup finger prints a few times.(2) Phone is getting very hot (even with thick case) when using camera, google maps and other apps that rely on GPS continuously.(3) Occasional unbearable overheating. Sometimes the phone display also seems to get hot and sweat / warm my thigh when in pocket, an uncomfortable feeling when you can't reach the phone (say, when driving a car).(4) When u install and try a new app even for a few mins... something (may be android intelligence service) is trying to save user behavior and drains alot of battery (and heats the phone). Battery draining and heating are due to the service burning 2-3 processor cores for several sustained minutes. Unfortunately the android APIs don't seem to allow viewing OS process level information to debug this issue. The HW monitoring apps show 2-3 cores pegged at 100% CPU.(5) Camera is good. The photo editing features (magic eraser, camouflage, unblur) are nifty.(6) Use only fingerprint unlock. The face unlock feature is not secure. Other reviewers were able to unlock the phone by presenting a photo of your face in another display (like a computer monitor or tablet).(7) Bought the snow white color. The white color looks very different and bright in-person than that in the photos (viewed on Google store on good displays). It is for sure not Snow White.. may be bright off-white.(8) The curved display is nice and doesn't bother me.(9) The phone is very slippery without a case.(10) Finding a good screen protector and case are tricky due to the curved display. I bought Spigen transparent case. Fits well, good grip, great protection. Still looking for a good screen protector.(11) Speakers are below average. They accentuate vocal frequencies and subdue bass. This nonlinear behavior can cause fatigue if you listen to vocals with shriller tones.(12) JerryRigEverything on YouTube in his standard test was able to curve/bend the phone relatively easily. Comparatively, the iPhone 14 series, Samsung Galaxy S22 / S23 Ultra were very sturdy. He pointed out that the antenna and related wiring are adjacent to the curving point of the metal frame might lead to reception issues. I hypothesize that users who complain about reception issues might have dropped the phone or experienced a subtle bending effect when in pocket.(13) The call screening feature and the live voice transcription feature are very useful.Expected better HW design from Google !Considering returning it.",Positive
4.0,"So first off this is a rectangular piece of equipment and most other phones can do what it does. I'm going to talk about a couple of features that make this insanely good and a couple of places where it fails to Samsung's ecosystem.Let's start with the fail - Samsung wins in the game manager, multi-window, multi-tasking, and unlocking realms. The Pixel is amateurish in its multi-window / multi-app approach in comparison, and the fact that the game center that Google has doesn't have a mute this game option is appalling.Now onto the win - the voice recognition is amazing... well, quick caveat on that it's amazing after a week or so of ownership. It quite had the dumbs when I first got the phone and learned me. It does offline / on phone translation when it learns you and it's a lot faster and better voice to text experience than I've had on any other phone. It's at least twice as fast and significantly more responsive than it is on my S21 Ultra, which has a faster processor in theory.Using the phone as a phone is delightful - it doesn't ring for scammers, spammers, etc... that's a setting I had to set... the phone will answer and screen calls on the device giving you a voice-to-text display of what they're saying to try and get you to answer. My phone rings very seldomly now. I love it.There are a bunch of call options that make the device feel like someone who used a telephone actually had some input...Unfortunately the monthly updates generally break something. Google's doing a lot of improvements but not a lot of evident testing. When I bought the phone, if I set a new alarm I knew I would wake up and the phone would be nearly dead on the wireless charger. Adaptive charging whether on or off and a new alarm = dead phone on a perfectly good wireless charger. This was mostly fixed, but still an occasional issue.I mention that one because it was reported in February 2022 on the pixel lines and it still is an occasiona problem in January 2023 with the Dec 2022 update.Good phone, extremely good as a telephone...",Positive
4.0,"I went from a Pixel 3 XL to the Pixel 7 Pro.  Here is my review of the Pro:1. Adaptive brightness is very slow2. Phone sometimes lags3. Maybe a bit faster with some things but basically the same as my Pixel 3 XL4. Phone sometimes freezes and I have to restart, which had finally been fixed in Android 125. Updates take hours but you can be on the phone during them, a win in my view6. Battery life is better7. What they don't tell you beforehand, is that the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro only support 64-bit apps; so you might find yourself missing some apps and games and icon packs, etc.8. Transfer of apps and stuff went very well9. In some apps, texting has a weird lag; you have to wait for the letters you type to show up, it's very aggravating10. The screenshot option works better; not the buttons, that option still sucks11. It charges okay: I went from 19% to 61% in 30 minutes; 85% in one hour12. The regular camera quality hasn't changed, although Night Sight seems to work poorly, adding a yellow tinge and even splotches of yellow - so Night Sight is much worse than my Pixel 3, see the photos to compare (comparison is between 2 photos taken with the Pixel 7 Pro, one with Night Sight and one without)13. The zoom camera function is why I opted for the Pro, and it is a lovely thing to have - see the photos of a shot with the normal range, then a shot of the same scene at the maximum 5x range14. There's an automatic macro setting which is nice, too.  Just bring the camera close to the object and it automatically adjusts to the macro setting15. The size is almost identical to my Pixel 3 XL, just a tiny bit taller and a tiny bit heavierIn all, I like the phone very much.  But if not for the zoom, I'd have been happy with the Pixel 7, I think.  In fact, I was still happy with my Pixel 3 XL.  If it wasn't for Google stopping the security updates, I wouldn't have upgraded; a big plus for the 7 Pro is Google's promise to support security updates for 5 years.  There is very little difference between the two phones, apart from the zoom/macro and how bad Night Sight is on the new camera.",Positive
