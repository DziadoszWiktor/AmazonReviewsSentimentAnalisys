566000,B000EHNCZ4,A10LZHOJ0910QE,Samson,2,2,3,1251763200,Hit and miss,"I love these bars - that's why when I get a stale pack, I am so upset.  It's not even passed it's ""best by"" date - but it's close Oct. 29, 2009.<br /><br />If they are good, the center is airy and easy to chew.  If they are bad, they are just WRONG!  Stale tasting peanuts - hard chewy center.  Last year, I bit into one and chipped a tooth because it got my teeth out of alignment as I bit through it.<br /><br />I can't really blame it Amazon selling old boxes.  It seems like every other box is this way and the manufacturer needs to rethink their ""best by"" date."
566001,B000EHNCZ4,A2Y8IDC1FKGNJC,L. A.,2,2,5,1205625600,I love these~better than candy!,"These are so good. I love the crunchy peanuts on the outside and the chocolaty nougat on the inside. it is like a candy bar, but better because it is healthy, full of protein, not too sweet, and there is no gross aftertaste. This makes a perfect meal on the go. I always have one in my purse for those days when I have no time in between clients to stop for a meal. This fills me up until I can get to my next meal. It keeps me away from fast food garbage stops."
566002,B000EHNCZ4,A2RWADO69FZESK,MAU,1,1,1,1243382400,What happened?,"Every Kashi product I have purchased has always been great.  I don't know if these were stale or what, but they tasted awful, like stale peanuts and no flavor.  In addition, the center was so chewy that my jaw hurt after eating one.  I gave it one star because if you really need something when you are out hiking in the middle of nowhere, it was filling.  I think the 2 worst things about this were 1) all other Kashi bars I have tried are really yummy, and 2)it LOOKS like it would taste great. I would recommend the chocolate almond bars instead."
566003,B000EHNCZ4,A10AGFN93JCNHQ,Livi Marin D.,1,1,3,1220313600,Mixed feelings about this product,"Fiber snack.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this roll.  While it is tasty, it is messy, too.  Unlike other bars Kashi puts out, this one loses it's form.  Most bars retain their shape.  This one gets sticky, so have a napkin and/or  water handy. It does curb your appetite and gives you the benefits of fiber . . . all pluses."

566006,B000EHNCZ4,A2JEV6CE0XVA5C,"Stacy VB ""mother, scholar, online shopper ext...",2,3,5,1170115200,"tasty, filling, and very healthy!","This is my favorite meal replacement bar.  It is lower calorie and a lot lower sugar (and not so sickly sweet) as a lot of the bars out there and has very high fiber and protein content.  It is very chewy, which, contrary to other reviewers of this bar, I find to be one of its strong points.  You have to bite, chew, and it eat slowly, which contributes to overall satisfaction.  The combination of crunchy and chewy is interesting.  And there is a lot of flavor here.  It won't be like eating a candy bar, but it is better, in my opinion, than eating any of its sweeter cousins.  The caramel peanut roll, not so far available on Amazon, is also very good."
566007,B000EHNCZ4,A1G6SB0FDFG9TB,Lesley K,2,3,5,1169164800,Excellent For On The Go,"In my job - I don't have much time to sit down for lunch, and frequently am on the road during lunch time.  I grab one of these rolls in the morning and can eat it for lunch.  It is extremely filling, considering the lower calorie content than most other meal replacement bars.  Also - tastes better than many of the other bars I have tried.  It is chewy and crunchy at the same time!"
566008,B000EHNCZ4,A15ZHWCP3C6Z7E,zoe,2,3,1,1168646400,Yuk,"I only made it 1/3 of the way through the Kashi Chocolate Peanut Roll. I enjoy eating other brand 'energy' and 'protein' bars (all of which have at least HALF the amount of sugar that this bar has) and hoped that this one would be tasty. It was extremely stiff to bite into, and much of the outer coating of rice fell off as I was trying to lever a bite from the roll. The dry aftertaste is like stale unsalted peanuts and with no hint of chocolate."
566009,B000EHNCZ4,A2OCIFFEONE928,Eiluj,0,0,3,1343692800,OK but not awesome (for me),"arrived 7/30/12. A tasty snack....just not quite what I was expecting. Seems a little too sweet (maybe thats me), also the texture (again for me) was odd. Will use them as a lunch bag snack as they have protein in them....good to keep me going when I don't get to go for a real break (work in an E/R)....much prefer the protein/fiber bar that has the peanut butter & chocolate flavor. Hard to find them in the stores these days.....oh well...enjoy!"

It comes teenager approved, my son, his friends and also I love the taste and the powerhouse of good stuff it packs."

566013,B000EHNCZ4,A1F58EKCE219K8,SeaOwlMurf,0,0,5,1305676800,Scrumptous!,The only drawback to these ROLL energy bars is that they are so good that you have to exercise a high degree of self control or your supply will suddenly be depleted>
566014,B000EHNCZ4,APESRHBA4QL3S,"Avid Reader ""Avid Reader""",0,0,5,1226793600,convenient,"These are full of protein and fiber.  My husband takes them for breakfast.  He can eat them on his long drive.  They are tasty, full of protein and fiber, and not messy."
566015,B000EHNCZ4,A1KUGF6RGJMVEB,asdf4,0,0,5,1210982400,one of the best protein bars!,"I'm an energy bar fanatic and try almost every new product. This one along w/ Odwalla's Super Protein are one of the best out there. Great taste (like a real, unhealthy chocolate bar!) and great nutritional value (taking into consideration fat, sugar, quality of ingredients, etc.)!"
566016,B000EHNCZ4,A1CPB0AJR8NF29,Schriftsteller,3,5,3,1211328000,Box crushed during shipment,"In my review of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006VHMG8"">EAS AdvantEdge Carb Control Nutrition Bar, Chocolate Peanut Butter Crisp, 12 Bars</a>, I noted that though the bars were good, they were often slightly melted or crushed during shipment.<br /><br />I decided to take another chance on ordering meal bars from Amazon. This time, I ordered Kashi meal bars, which have slightly more carbohydrate than the AdvantEdge bars but don't contain sugar alcohols, which give me gas.<br /><br />The Kashi bars are great: all 11 of them. The box contained 12 bars, but it was severely crushed during shipment, which destroyed the 12th bar. I know that the damage occurred during shipment because the outside box in which Amazon shipped the meal-bar box was crushed like an accordion, worse than the boxes of AdvantEdge bars ever were.<br /><br />So, my review of the Kashi bars is pretty the same as for the AdvantEdge bars. Kashi bars are a good product, but they're sometimes melted or crushed during shipment.<br /><br />With 11 usable Kashi bars in the box I just received, Amazon's lower price still makes them slightly cheaper than they are at the supermarket. But it's chancy. You can never be sure if the product will arrive in good condition."
566017,B000EHNCZ4,A2QMFSKOKQF4P0,"Natalie B. Gomez ""NatGo""",3,5,5,1175299200,My favorite bar!,"High in protein, low in calories, and great flavor.  I split them in half and eat the first portion as a mid-morning snack and the second portion as an afternoon snack.  They keep me feeling full and prevent me from eating junk food, which has been great for my waistline.  I can't say enough good things about Kashi!"
