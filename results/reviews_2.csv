5.0,"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get."
5.0,"I had a Samsung S20 FE and the camera shots and videos were horrible, not to mention the long delay in between snapshots. The screen on the S20 was way too sensitive and I was always opening apps by mistake. The battery life was better on the old S20 but the photos are way better quality on the S24 Ultra which is important to me. Transferring apps was really easy using Smart Switch.The new phone is about the same size. Some of the menu options have been moved or the names have changed but easy to adapt. I love the fingerprint access and it works beautifully if you don't do it too quickly. I wish the new phone had an SD card for local storage and I wish there was a setting to keep the screen on longer. I like the android operating system and love the ability to record phone calls. It is legal where I live and handy when someone gives you an address or important instructions."
5.0,"If there were ever a device deserving of a 10-star rating, it's the SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra.

5.0,"Amazing device, haven't discovered any major downsides beside fingerprint scanner. Sometimes it takes time to find the position for a finger in a sweet spot, even thought I ran several times fingerprint memo app.Very good battery life even with heavy use.Sharp and crisp display.Very good camera, yet it trying to shift colors at night to more saturated chemical, especially yellow can end up copper-like color."
1.0,"Since my S22 Ultra died, I began phone shopping. The S22 Ultra is an amazing phone, however it had several flaws. Nevertheless though, I thought for my next phone I would again go with a Samsung S24 Ultra. I was a little worried, since there have been a lot of people online talking about the S24 Ultra's screen quality being particularly bad for a Samsung device. Usually, the displays on these phones are some of the best. However, people online would talk about how the uniformity on the screen is bad, that there are color banding issues, or that it's extremely grainy relative to their old device. Honestly though, I wanted to order one and find out for myself. Were these issues really that bad, or was it a small problem blown out of proportion?Hoooooh boy...!When my S24 Ultra came in, the first god damn thing I noticed WAS the grain. Jesus christ, that grain. Yes guys, it is serioisly that bad. I believe some S24 Ultras don't have the grain nearly as bad as some others, but the device I recieved had the most atrocious OLED grain I have ever seen in my life. It would just turn any solid color, smooth gradient, and everything really, into a construction paper drawing. I AM NOT EXAGGERATING, IT IS REALLY THAT BAD. Under the glass, it looks like the manufacturers sprinkled colorful moonsand onto the OLED panel. The pictures I'm attaching this review do not do it justice, it is way worse in person and is there regardless of brightness. EVEN AT MAX BRIGHTNESS!!!It's a shame, because the phone is truly amazing otherwise. The cameras aren't as good as the specs and marketing would have you believe, especially with their default shutter speeds and motion handling, but they are certainly good. The performance is OUT of this world! If you're a power user, the S24's overclocked SD 8 Gen 3 is truly the king of Android SoCs, it is unbelievable. Never seen a stutter or hitch on this device when doing anything. It feels amazing to hold, it's weighty and certainly feels premium. The S Pen is an amazing feature, as well as the AI Stuff, the battery life is great. I really, really, really, REALLLY wanted to like this phone but... Yeah, naaaah. The display that my device arrived with is really that bad. Even my old S10e's screen is as smooth as butter, and as beautiful as I remember a proper OLED screen being. This one is just horrible.As for alternatives, I would suggest the Red Magic 9 Pro ($649!!!), the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12r ($700-$800 and $500 respectively), the Z Fold 5/OnePlus Open (considerably more expensive, but the form factor on those is killer), any of the iPhones, and even the damn S23U! (Gets all the same features as the S24 Ultra, just on a SoC that is marginally slower for practical use, and without the damn sandpaper screen)Incredibly disappointed. Stay away from these devices until Samsung has issued a statement or has totally fixed the screen problems!If you've made it this far, here's a cute picture of my pet cat. You've earned it."
5.0,"I read a lot of negative reviews about this phone and skipped the pre order, regrettably. Finally purchased this and have had the phone for a couple of months. It is amazing. Truly the screen colors are just fine coming from a Galaxy Edge 10. It's a beautiful phone. Smooth. So many options on this phone I couldn't use them all. Many options to make my life easier, grocery lists, Ai search for a family is a must. When the child says they want something on TV,  snap a Pic and search by phone later. This phone is a great option, don't let it overwhelm you if you're coming from a flip phone. You can use as little of the functionality of this phone as you are comfortable with and it will be there for all the high tech things you want to do. High res pictures is SPECTACULAR! Can't believe I took pictures of my family that were so blurry before, almost laughable. We'll no more! I would recommend this phone to all my friends and family even the iPhone user, this is way better."
5.0,"I can’t really give a reliable review about the product, except that it looked really really nice, it was a bit heavy for a phone, & I like some of the abilities it can do, the storage is really nice too, that’s my opinion, but I bought it for a friend & can’t really give any info besides what I have given already. I do apologize. But I give 5 star because it had arrived safe, on schedule & without any damage."
4.0,"I've only owned every version of the Note series (now Ultra) since Note 4 (did not own the bendy screen one, just regular). So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, ""hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them"".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's ""USED"" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was ""USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box"". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy."
4.0,It is a very nice phone. It can do a lot. The zoom on the phone is incredible. The clarity of the screen is I feel pretty good. The quality of all the pictures is a little bit to be said. Do not get me wrong it takes some pretty darn good pictures. My biggest problem with the pictures is that it takes a great picture of the item that you're taking a picture of. But blurs out the background. The only other thing that I'm really kind of disappointed about. Is the volume as far as on the phone. Phone calls. Even on speaker phone. If you have any kind of noise around you you will not build to hear it. It can play media very loud And usually have to turn it down a little. If they would find a way to fix the volume on phone calls. That would be a plus.
4.0,"The first phone I ordered came in an open box when the description said new. When I called Amazon customer service they told me to inspect the phone and turn it on. When I turned it on, I discovered the phone is locked to Verizon and not unlocked like the description said.Customer service encouraged me to return the phone and reorder the same phone. They were unable to send a replacement which would been a much simpler solution for me. They were also unable to explain why they sent me a used product when I ordered a new phone.The second phone I ordered has lived up to my expectations, now I just have to hope I get my refund."
3.0,"The bad:Screen colors recently fixed so I upped the stars to 3Reception is middling (compared to my Note 20 Ultra it's a bit worse)Camera white balance is straight green/blue and images/video are just darkWide angle camera is not as wide as my Note 20 and no better qualityWhen on speakerphone, the top speaker cuts out if you get close to the top speaker.Generally jagged user experience due to a bunch of Samsung crap that cannot be removed.Bloody expensive for something that's delivered in this state.The meh:Batt life is good (not great, just good) only if run in 60hz and low power mode.In low power mode at 120hz the batt life is merely acceptable.All compared to my 3yr old note 20 in low power 60hz mode which is just below acceptable.The good:The antireflective coating on the screen is genuinely amazingThe 120hz on the screen is uber smooth but unfortunately hits the battThe rest is fine; not different from my Note 20 UltraThere's a thread on the Samsung forum that's thousands of posts long about these same issues I've brought up here. The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20."
5.0,"Changed my S21+ for this S24 and I couldn't be happier on the downsizing. Doubled the storage space with half inch less. The screen still has a great size to be able to use all my apps and I can handle it much better than the Ultra or the Plus models. It would be good to have this model with the best chipset, memory and caches, but I'll settle for something I can handle single handed."
5.0,"Signed up for galaxy s24+ on day of release. Was glad to step up from s21. One thing I miss is the micro SD card for additional storage. Having all storage embedded in the phone may increase performance; however, it also eliminates local storage upgrade options. Only real option is to use cloud storage if local storage grows too quickly.Really love the quality improvements for the camera!! Improved screen and slight screen increase from base to + models is a nice touch. I remain impressed with the screen.After months I am very happy with the s24+."
4.0,I am very happy with the battery life and the charge quickness. the screen is bright and vivid. phone works as it is supposed to. I still don't like the fact that you don't get a charge block. it used to be an experience to purchase a smartphone. unboxing was have of the purchase. now they might as well send it in a zip-lock bag because you only get the phone and a cable. $1400+ I feel like Samsung has just charged me more money for less product. If you are like me and use the S pen daily then this is the phone for you but if not get the s24+ or just the s24. I got the s24 for my employees and they all love them good phones at a much nicer price point around $700.The battery life on this phone is bar none! I went about 56hrs without charging the other day and I was using it most of the time. I was taking video watching and editing videos. surfing for vday presents on line and talked to about 30 customers on the phone once I realized that I hadnt charged in two days and i still had 16% left I was blown away. My s22 ultra wouldnt even last the day and it would never super fast charge. this phone always charges fast about 38 mins to full from 5%.
5.0,You will not be disappointed buying this item. Of course you'll need to loose a liver or leg because is expensive. But the phone works marvelous without any issues and with lots of memory. Some people may be disappointed of the phone getting hot but others be not. The hotness will not really cost any problems. I have a supercharger 45watts that quickly charges the phone and unexpectedly doesn't overheats the phone. The device has a long battery life. But hey... is your decision if you want this extremely expensive device but worth item to obtain.
5.0,"Estaba un poco escéptica, pedí este teléfono para regalo a mi hijo en su cumple 15, sin embargo, lo que él me dice es: Lo único es que la batería siente que no dura, se lleva el teléfono cargado y a mitad del día debe poner a cargar otra vez.  No dura todo un día cargado para ser un teléfono de alta gamaFunciona muy bien para Venezuela, él lo tiene con Movistar y funciona excelente."
5.0,"Look are you finding yourself squinting at a menu? This telephone is big, easy to read, makes google maps easy to hear and see. All without a hearing aid or a magnifying glass; so get out your walker and get over to your computer and order this phone it makes life easy. So much easier for everything, banking, financial investments... communications great product...just do yourself a favor and get a defender otter case to go with it. Highly recommend. By the way your doctor will love you if you get the galaxy 6 watch with it...at least when I am dead the paramedics can look at my watch and confirm it!"
5.0,I loved my Galaxy S9 Plus and replaced it with S24 Plus.  S24 Plus is lighter with a slightly larger screen and has a lot more features people talk about here.  Visibly the photos are of higher quality.  Battery lasts a lot longer.  It was so easy to transfer the data from my old phone.  I love it!
4.0,"I have a S24 Ultra Factory Unlocked I save my contacts  in the following format 1 area code 7digits.  For example +1 345 123 4567If I call a contact with 7digits (123 4567), I see their name. But when I hit dial only the number appears.  In my call logs it only shows the number.If I dial the contact using area code all is well.  I have removed and replaced contacts.  I have moved contacts from Google to phone and back.Software is up to date"
4.0,"Switching from my Note 10 Plus to the Samsung Ultra S24 was a big move for me. The new phone works a lot like my old one, and I could easily transfer all my stuff to it. I haven't really figured out the AI stuff yet, but the camera is good, and the battery lasts a long time. The phone is a bit heavy and thick, but I'm happy with its size overall."
5.0,"Love the phone so far. Switching back from a Motorola.  Sound is great, music is so much better,  fingerprint sensor is on the screen not on the side yeah. Pictures are just amazing and I haven't really taken many. It is easy to use"
5.0,What can I say the device is wonderful. I don't need a computer because it does everything a computer does and them some more features. I  love that I can call someone and for example speak English and the other person on the other like the AI translate to Spanish (for example). It edits my pictures. I love it comes with more storage space..
4.0,"Please keep in mind if you are buying this phone to use it in the Liberty PR network, the group texting won't work. Everything else works fine."
5.0,"I'm very amazed by this phone I had the Galaxy. S20, This phone was a huge advancement over my old phone. I read some of the reviews and was a little bit worried but it is the absolute best phone i've ever had. I really like the styling. I have it in a case which covers it up nicely, and it wasn't extremely expensive, the phone was quite expensive, but oh well. Figure I might not live forever so why not enjoy life a little and have the toys I want.If you got the bucks for this, get it and get the biggest memory that you could afford.  I took these pictures with the solar viewing glasses. And then the ones where the sun is a ring around the moon were without anything in front of the camera. I had the phone on a tripod. And I used voice command to make it, take the pictures. It really did amazing taking pictures of the eclipse. I really love the stylus pen it is going to be very handy."
5.0,"Sansung realmente se esforzó por hacer un buen celular, este lo tiene todo. La batería me dura hasta el final del día sin ningún problema. La camara es hermosa. El celular va muy fluido. Totalmente recomendado 😻 fan de Samsung"
5.0,C'mon Apple users.. you guys have no idea what's a great and most advanced phone in the WORLD! NO IDEA!This thing BLOWS out of the water any Apple phone product.. ha!Enough said!
5.0,"Very good. Daughter was very excited about it.Package intact. Only downside of this new Samsung, generally speaking, is the fact the model is missing a extra slot for a memory card. I know 256GB memory sound a lot, but in reality is not. Maybe Samsung will amend this for the future.....Quite good overall!"
5.0,"Love, so far. I love the fingerprint sensor.  Many great features over what my s20+ had. I gave my s20 to my wife to replace her old s10 which wasn't 5g or wifi6 compatible."
5.0,"What can I say?? Beautiful piece of a phone...I'm still learning my way around my phone....it's much better than my Note 10+. Pix come out some much clearer. I happened to find an app thar allows my home screen to change n the background, which I couldn't find on my Note 10+ and I think is pretty awful. Love the different customizations that I can do too."
5.0,"I love this phone, the camera is great, the only issue I really have is the battery goes dead too fast but not really a big issue all in all it's the best phone I've ever had"
3.0,"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data."
5.0,"The camera quality is good. The ai function is also great.It's my first time using a Galaxy phone, and the more I use it, the more comfortable it is."
4.0,"phone worked fine , too big, and the design a little outdated , I decided to return it , the return experience with amazon has been really bad , they did not acknowledge they had received the item and they did not refund until 45 days after item was shipped back. really very bad experience overall"
5.0,Needed to replace my Note 9 due to it being run over by a vehicle in a parking lot. Very happy with the S24 Ultra so far. I better be with the price tag of these new phones now. The battery lasts a lot longer than the Note 9 battery ever did. I am happy so far. Also I am now using a belt attached pouch to hold the phone now due to the price of these phones. My Note 9 became detached from a Otterbox belt clip while loading material at a local big box store. Evidently the belt clip attachment was probably getting too worn to hold the phone securely.
4.0,Me gusta todo
5.0,"I don't upgrade my phone every year like everyone else. Coming from the Galaxy Note8, this thing is INCREDIBLE. The S24 is the perfect size for a phone imo. There is no downside to this phone. It has almost everything from the Ultra at a more reasonable price AND it's not a giant bulky, square piece of screen. Good job Samsung"
5.0,"i am a samsung-ite, so of course i have a bias going in this, i love the flat-screen, the size is great (i wish they would come out with an 8"" screen, i would love that) it is ok with me that they dropped the micro sd card slot (i subscribe to google-one with the 2TB plan) but whatever you do samsung, i beg you please DO NOT follow the iphone and drop the sim-card slot (this is critically important) the e-sim thing is fantastic, i noticed one extra hour of smartphone battery time (the 4900 miliamp vs the s23+ 4700) i get 7 hrs vs 6hrs (galaxy s23+)  but one great complaint, that thousands have complained about: ""the washed-out screen display) YES INDEED!!!! i compare for example the galaxy s23+ homescreen vs the galaxy s24+ homescreen, ANYONE WITH TWO WORKING EYEBALLS CAN SEE THIS VERY CLEARLY!!!, now i can live with this, but this is a MAJOR BIG DEAL!!!, and samsung supposedly did a software update to correct this??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! FORGET IT, NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER!!! but as i say i am a samsung-guy so it wont kill me, BUT IT IS A BLACK-EYE AND I WILL REMEMBER THIS SAMSUNG!!!"
5.0,"I love the Galaxy Ultras for the cameras. So far, they don't disappoint. I'm also happy with battery life."
5.0,"This phone has a ton of awesome features, great customization options and the freedom to use it the way you want to. Sure, the ecosystem just isn't a smooth or as rich as Apples ecosystem. However, messaging form your computer works with every OS. This is a large selling point for me since my laptop is a mac and my gaming desktop is a windows machine. Whenever my phone iPhone was on my charger at my desk I couldn't respond from my computer because iMessage is not supported on windows machines. Typical Apple gatekeeping. With this device not only do I get an amazing camera with 100x zoom, but I get to use it however I want. Oh, and I can actually see my wallpaper because I'm not forced to have my home screen icons slapped all over the top of it. What's the point of a wallpaper if you can't see it? I could go one and on. TLDR; I love this phone. I just wish phones weren't so expensive. They used to be way more affordable than they are today for a top of the line device. Oh, and the s-pen? Amazing."
5.0,Got it for the wife she loves it..does things she didnt know they would doshe is so happy with it..could have came with the E sim though..would have been a lot better to transfer everything..But if you want a dang good samsung get the S24..its a great phone
4.0,"I like my phone,  but most of the time I can't hear out of it."
5.0,"The cell phone is practically brand new. I love my phone, it's all that I hoped for. Will definitely recommend it...."
5.0,Super fast. The camera quality is great! Definitely recommend. It is on the smaller side. So if you want a bigger phone go with the ultra. But the regular is fine for me!
4.0,"It's a phone. The A.I. stuff is pretty fun to mess with, but not entirely practical for daily use. That said, the camera is fantastic. I took these pics from the back of a dark venue from about 110-ish feet away. To me, concert pics are the true litmus test of a phone camera, and this is, without a doubt, the best I've ever had. Would I buy it again? Eh, yeah, probably. I just wish it were cheaper."
5.0,I didn’t realize I could by a phone from Amazon- came new in perfect condition was easy to setup through my phone company.
5.0,I really like the size and quality of images in the photos and all the apps.
5.0,"Have been Note Guy forever and this is my first S series, very impressive and once you've programming with disabling most features that slow down the performances, this device becomes so powerful."
4.0,I've used apple more. I prefer apple maps and apple is much more user friendly but samsung has overall better deal more gp per buck.
5.0,"fast response between loading and seeking, decent battery life, storage big enough for what i do"
5.0,"I usually  buy a new phone every three years or so.  This one replace my Samsung S10, which I liked a lot.This phone has an incredible battery life, a fantastic camera and display.  I don't have anything negative to say about this device.  I will be purchasing another one for my wife."
5.0,"Llego en el tiempo establecido todo en perfectas condiciones tal y como lo describe, pase de un s9+ a un s24 ultra, muy buenas cámaras yen general una buena adquisición."
4.0,Bixby is not a problem with this Phone like earlier models
4.0,Specs wise it's exactly the same as the S24 ultra which is what I wanted. I'm personally not interested in all the cameras or stylus.However I'm not impressed with the 6.2 size and the iPhone-ish block looks of the body.Ironically I feel like this phone has less features than the One Plus Nord that has thumb unlock on the power button and so many UI choices not to mention the larger screen size for half the price!I also wasn't to impressed with the Samsung bloatware that can't be uninstalled unlike other unlocked phones.Over all it's an okay phone if you want something powerful and small.I just wish Samsung offered a larger sized phone without all the cameras and what not that someone like me that doesn't want or need.
5.0,Este teléfono sin duda es de muy buena calidad
5.0,Excelente teléfono
5.0,"Love the phone! Great phone all around. The camera is fantastic! Kudos to Samsung for adding the pen; The pen is very responsive and accurate, and it works across Samsung devices."
4.0,The phone is good with fast access and the camera os just amazing... what disappointed was the amazing packing...my  kids toy were well packed than the phone ordered.@Amazon pls be careful when you pack the phones
5.0,Went from the s10 plus to the s20fe. Hated the s20fe and super glad to have the 24plus. Seems like a great phone already.
5.0,God the purple colour. Love the feel and look of it.
3.0,"So considering the phone I came from, this one is amazing! I give it that for sure! If your upgrading from a cheap phone with a bad camera, then do it! BUT, not that this price, if your after it for the amazing zoom quality... no it's useless...So here's the thing, idk if it's a fake I got, or if the zoom on the 24 ultra is just that bad, because I have seen the 22 in action,  and it's 1000x better, the zoom is the only Reason I even went for this phone to begin with honestyNow the phone I came from was a shitty BLU 91 pro, so yes, it's an amazing upgrade, but when your buying something specifically for sertan aspects of the camera, it's kinda sad.... so again, idk if I somehow got a fake or the zoom really is just that bad. It's Definitely not worth the tag if either of those are the case.If you can catch it on sale for under $800, go for it, but at $1,200 not worth it."
3.0,"I switched from Galaxy S7. I love the S7 but the CPU and RAM can't keep up with today's apps and websites. The S24 a decent phone with some annoying problems. It feels like a $400-500 phone.Here are my complaints:- The most annoying problem so far is that videos are glitchy, choppy, or laggy every few seconds. Whatever you want to call it, it's the opposite of smooth. This happens in every streaming app and website I've tried so it's not isolated to a single app. It's not a bandwidth or buffering issue. This happens in Adaptive (120 Hz) and Standard (60 Hz) motion smoothness. I enabled the Show Refresh Rate option in the Developer menu. I don't know if it's accurate, but every time a video gets laggy the refresh rate shows 24 (in Hz). When it shows 60 or 120 the video is smooth. The OS should should detect if a video is playing and sync to the frame rate of the video or set a fixed 60 Hz refresh rate.- The physical buttons click very loudly. When I hear that click my brain thinks ""cheap junk"". They're loudest buttons of any current or previous phone or tablet we own (which is a lot). I'm guessing this is a QC issue and most people don't experience this. I have resorted to using apps to open the volume control and turn off the screen so I don't need to click those buttons.- All three buttons are on the same side now. I need to use two hands to reliably take a screen shot. Yes, I have gotten it to work a couple times with only my right thumb but only after locking the screen and changing the volume a few times.- Samsung frequently nags me about signing in. I have uninstalled and disabled as many Samsung apps as possible, but it keeps asking me to sign in."
5.0,Amazon gave me $200 gc so thats cool
5.0,"On my trip to US, bought the s24(Snapdragon), brought it to Germany back, works perfectly."
5.0,I like the bigger size - it is easier for me to text correctly the first time. Camera is fantastic. I got the 512GB storage.  Things I didn't care for: 1)  It automatically installed new messaging app and if you use it you can get your next texts back into the old app. I don't like it because you can't see a preview of links you send out. 2) You cannot use an SD card to store pictures and files external to your Samsung account. I prefer to keep those things private and back them up to an external hard drive.
4.0,"La bateria al ser 4000 milianperios esta supuesto a no durar casi nada pero samsung hizo un trabajo increble con la optimizacion. Es un celular tan poderoso que no tiene ningun problema con jugar juegos exigentes. Las animaciones de este celular estan a otro nivel ya que muestra animaciones bonitas al escuchar musica y al abrir aplicaciones. El unico problema que tiene el celular son las camaras, no estan optimizadas ya que al procesar cualquier imagen con la camara de 50 megapixeles salen las imagen con mucha luz y se sienten algo quemadas. Lo que me dejo feliz fue la calidad de video ya que esta muy estabilizado y salen con buena calidad."
5.0,"Un gran celular y sobre todo su camara, es muy buena para tomar fotos desde cualquier lado , hasta de noche, tamaño óptimo y perfecto para el día a dia"

5.0,"I'm all too happy with this phone! I hadn't purchased a new phone in almost 4 years, so this was a very, very much needed upgrade. The difference in the operating system speed compared to my older phone is just mind-blowing. The phone is much faster, does not lag, and it has massive cameras. Haha. My old phone had baby size cameras. Lol! But seriously, this is a great phone!!!It does work for Verizon and Straighttalk by the way."
5.0,Good
5.0,"Love this ""computer"" which also happens to be a cell phone.  My son said so, and told me I would love it.  He was right!  It does so many things, just incredible.  There is a ""learning curve"" which I am presently having fun with.  This model comes with a stylet, and you can write a note to yourself and save it!  Pretty classy. Can't say anything about the battery, as I've only had it a short time."
5.0,"So I switched to this from a fold 3 (switched cuz of work environment) and I really like it, I've had little to no problems so farI've seen some complaints about the 150$ promotion amazon is having it does give it to u it doesn't apply it to ur account like a gift card tho, u have to buy something made and shipped from Amazon and when u go to check out it'll add a promotion to ur order filling what ever the cost was until u use all 150$Here the pros and cons I've noticedPros -Amazing battery life lasted me from 4:45am to  9pm with 15% remaining.Google image search biuld in to the phone, I love itCamera is way better then the fold but given the fold doesn't really focus on camera qualityCons -Here's the big oof with this phone, I haven't read too much in to it or anything but as to what I'm aware, 32bit system is getting dropped and newer phones are gonna now only support 64bit operating systems so u might loose some of the apps you had previously ( I lost around 12 apps/games ) and that's not saying it won't be fixed later on the dev could add 64bit to the app.Other then that I have no other complaints about it."
5.0,Super rápido fácil de configurar unas cámaras increíbles  un procesamiento  de alta gama. Su acabado en titanio me encanta. El venir desbloqueado facilito su uso en mi pais

5.0,Es el mejor celular del mercado sin duda.excelente equipo
5.0,"Long time Samsung user absolutely live this phone, feels different to have flat screen love this phone and features"
3.0,"First, data transfer: you have to go through a bunch of advertising hurdles and a treasure hunt to figure out what to do next.Later, much later when thanks to cheer luck and many tries later you finally get thing downloaded, you get a message ""to complete account setup click here"" > empty page.After trying several ways around, you get a message asking you to enter a code that was sent to the very email account you've been supposed to access for days to complete setup... Clever isn't it?Btw, i've been using android on many phones for years. Never seen so many hurdles.Nice photos..."
5.0,"the best smartphone,,"

5.0,"Elegante, bello simplemente uno de los mejores equipos."
5.0,Works great and the stylus is awesome.
4.0,"Phone is great so far.  My issue is with Amazon customer service.  I never received the $150 e-gift card.  I contacted customer service and they act like they have no idea what I am talking about even though I sent them a screenshot of the order showing it was redeemed.UPDATE:  As someone else mentioned, you have to purchase something that is shipped and sold from Amazon.  Pretty limiting.  I wanted to purchase a new charger -  Samsung, Anker, Ugreen all ship from their own stores.  Also, it shows as a discount rather than a Gift Card."
5.0,Still learning it
5.0,Phone has give me zero issues and I like it so far. Very clear screen with great HD for things like Netflix and useful for notes. I often take pictures on power points and eaily extract the text and put them into notes. Noise canceling is amazing.  👏
5.0,"Great phone, i am just started using it, easy to configure, has great photo and video quality."
5.0,Great phone. Pictures are amazing!
4.0,Todo bien
5.0,Very good phone.
5.0,I came from having a one plus 7pro phone to a Samsung galaxy s24 ultra. This phone takes amazing pictures. It's so quick and the battery lasts me a long time. I don't really use the stilus but it's great as a remote to take group pictures when no one is around to take a picture.
3.0,"This new Samsung S24 Ultra is not much better than the Galaxy Note 10 plus that it replaced Ram memory both have same 12 GB, cosider that note 10plus came out five 5 years ago. The screen resolution is higher, true but makes little difference in real life applications and videos. Same screen size as my note 10 plus 6.8 and no memory card. Is much heavier than the note 10 and bulky and the flat screen doesn't make much difference. To be truthful most users don't get to use not even 50% of the feature that these phones offer including me. So why not concentrate their resources in a truly better screen experience and interactive features that can be used in a day-to-day basis like email and chats. This phone doesn't justify the high price tag of $1675 retail by Samsung website. At least I got a better price here in Amazon, so I don't feel that bad. This phone will be replaced soon, I'm pretty sure.  I apologize for pointing out the not too good things, but I feel disappointed, I had higher expectations from a $1600 cell phone. Don't understand some reviewers here unless they were coming from a really basic phone. Be your own judge and keep posting your experiences. It helps. Kudos to Amazon for a super-Fast delivery!!!!!"
5.0,SAMSUNG GALAXY S24+ IS VERY INNOVATIVE WITH IMPROVED CAMERA FEATURES AND WAS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT FOR THE UPGRADED FEATURES.
5.0,"Siempre quise este equipo y ahora lo tengo, esta buenísimoLo único que veo es que a mi anterior teléfono (red magic 9 pro)La batería en este dura poco menos de un día"
5.0,"Excelente teléfono. Su diseño es muy elegante,  su potencia y batería ni se diga."
5.0,If you like to take pictures this phone is for you.  It takes crisp bright pictures.  I love the size and color.  I would purchase again.
