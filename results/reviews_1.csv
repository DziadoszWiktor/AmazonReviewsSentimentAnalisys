5.0,"March 2024 update: Most software kinks worked out at this point, phone still feels fantastic to use. Definitely not the best battery life or most efficient processor, however it's still very fast and usable for everything, gaming included. Cameras really are spectacular - everyone I talk to loves the pictures I take with this phone. Good image processing too. List of pixel exclusive features keeps growing, definitely worth it for those.Idk what other people are doing when they are having issues getting their carrier to register on their phone - for me it took about 5 seconds during the setup process after transferring my SIM from my pixel 6 to the 8 pro, and it was all set.Phone is less of a toaster than my pixel 6, better cameras, feels faster - ill get back to this in a moment - better screen, lots of really cool software features that are worth spending the time to learn about.Does it actually feel faster? 100% yes - however you should remember that this is a brand new phone, and depending on what data you transfer over, it's going to take some time to ""relearn"" or recache your habits and such, so certain things are gonna load a little slow at first, but speed up a lot over time - this is expected behavior. Also keep in mind since it's still new, there are some bugs here and there that software updates will work out over time. I noticed a couple, nothing that majorly impacts my usage though.Overall, fantastic phone, really easy setup - esp if you had a pixel prior - I really like the shade of blue they used as well for the pro, good case choice can compliment it quite nicely. I do kind of wish the titanium was less shiny, but its not a big deal for me."
5.0,"OMG, the Pixel 8 Pro is, like, the coolest phone ever! üòç I've had it for a few weeks now, and it's seriously lit. Here are some of the reasons why I'm totally loving it:Camera Game Strong üì∏: The camera on this phone is next level. The pics I take with it are so clear and vibrant. Selfies, group pics, and even low-light shots look awesome. It's basically a mini photographer in my pocket.Speedy Gonzales ‚ö°: This phone is, like, super fast. Apps open in a snap, and I can play all my fave games without any lag. It's like having a little gaming console right in my hands.Gorgeous Display üì±: The screen is, like, amazing! It's big and bright, and watching videos or playing games is a total blast. The colors are so vibrant, and it's, like, perfect for binge-watching Netflix.Battery for Days üïí: The battery life is, like, epic. I use my phone all day, and it still has juice left when I go to bed. No more worrying about it dying on me.5G for Speed Freaks üì∂: With 5G, I can, like, download stuff crazy fast and stream without any buffering. It's like the internet is on turbo mode.Android All the Way ü§ñ: I'm a big fan of Android, and this phone runs the latest version, so I get all the cool features and updates. Customization options are on fleek.Sleek Design üòé: The phone looks super sleek and modern.

I'm in love with mine, and I'm pretty sure you will be too! üòÑüëç #Pixel8ProRocks"
5.0,"I had a pixel 3, which I loved. I ended up upgraded to the pixel 6 when it released. I swapped from pixel 6 to a galaxy s22 ultra after about a year because of all the bugs, which were mostly minor at that point. After using the s22 ultra for just under a year, I was really missing my pixel 6 despite all the bugs it had at launch and the minor ones it still has when I upgraded. Decided to get a pixel 8 and I'm very happy I did. The galaxy s22 ultra was an amazing phone, but I just didn't make use of all of its features and the pixel layout is more favorable in my opinion. Phone runs great, no lagging, no bugs that I can think of. The AI stuff is cool, display is amazing, battery life is great, cameras are amazing, and the phone feels awesome. One of the biggest improvements I immediately noticed over the pixel 6 was the fingerprint reader. Overall, my favorite phone I've owned."
4.0,"I upgraded from S22 ultraI feel this phone is smooth, camera is phenomenal and the HDR and night boost is amazing. It does take time to upload and process the videos but it's been great so far.The camera AI features are nice to have. Its hard to take good family pictures when going out sometimes so the face edit is neat , the only downside it works for 5 people at max. The AI size adjustments and moving stuff is nice but need to be precise so when moving objects, AI can properly fill the place behind itI've encountered some freezes at first but it stopped after the latest update.Battery is good, i never ran out of battery but i never tried going a full day out where i might need to charge, I also got a power bank that I can attach to the back of the phone with the magsafe case i got from dbrand , thats why i didn't complain about the battery. I only used the power bank when i forget to charge my phone at night.Screen brightness is really bright. At night it can be a flashbang if you're in your room with lights out, becareful of the auto brightness.AI features like summarize and call screening only works in the US? I ordered it to a frieght forwarder and shipped it overseas. The summarize and call screening doesnt work. Car keys and google VPN doesn't work either.Google gimini got introduced in a recent update, its the google version of chat GPT. It works well but sometimes it glitches out for example, I asked gimini "" show me the bullet train ticket prices from tokyo to kyoto "" . It showed me prices in JPY and I asked to convert to my local currency and he did, tried that again few days later and gmini apologize and said he can't do it.You can't have google assistant and gimini at the same time  when using shortcuts or the "" hey google "" . Sometimes im driving and i want to play a certain song but then i remember i have the gimini enabled and not assistant so i can't tell him to play the song because gimini answers questions and tasks are assistant's job.One con that really annoys me is the Bluetooth. Its weird. When i connect the phone to my car, sometimes it doesn't play the audio or the lag between audio and video is big, never had that in my s22 ultra. Also when playing music , my car screen always shows the song duration and name when using the S22 but on the pixel , it only shows the song title and no duration. Also there is a lag when displaying the song title.There is one tiny thing that i really liked is gesture control. You can double tap the back side of the phone to take screenshot or do a specific task, really cool. And the song auto detection is always welcomed. I once was watching a movie at home , the character was inCafe and the cafe had background music. The phone detected it and i was surprised.Thats is all what i can think of as of right now"
5.0,"This is my third Pixel phone. The first was the Pixel 2 XL, which was the largest at the time. I liked it, and it had a nice fingerprint reader on the back that always worked, and was easy to use. Plus it didn't get fingerprints on the screen. But after a few years, the battery was getting weak, and there were no updates. Plus, it didn't fully support the modern carriers.The Pixel 6 kind of sucked because the antenna wasn't very good, so it didn't always pick up a signal. The fingerprint reader was on the front screen, and worked OK, but not perfect. It had a slightly bigger screen, but the phone was about the same size as the 2 XL, and it was usable.Then my son bought me this Pixel 8 Pro. I was surprised that it was almost the same size as my Pixel 6. The antenna was much better and seems to get strong signal everywhere so far. But best of all, it has face recognition, which works pretty well, as long as there's enough light, and I'm not wearing sunglasses or a mask. But the fingerprint reader seems to work very well for me, too, when needed, although some people complain (surprise!). I have a Spigen glass screen protector on it, and it doesn't seem to adversely affect it."
1.0,"It pains me to criticize what is probably a very good phone, but I've pretty much reached my limit with products that are sold with absolutely no regard for the consumer.This cell phone is boxed with no charging cable (only a data transfer cable) and no Instruction or User manual.  To shell out $1,000 for a phone that you cannot charge or find out how to use without purchasing additional items or going on YouTube to watch a video is near criminal, in my opinion.  There is not even a diagram that shows where the power on/off button is located, where to insert the SIM card, where the volume control button is, etc.  I'm sure the phone has a lot of wonderful features, but good luck guessing as to what they are, or how to take advantage of them, without any type of insert or manual to read.I've gone through this problem before, and it seems that the more expensive the item is, such as a computer or television, the less assistance is provided at the time of purchase in terms of its usage and functionality.  Enough is enough!  To not even include a wall adapter to charge the phone is the height of ridiculousness and absolute cheapness on Google's part.  You just spend $1,000 and their response is to thumb your nose at you, with the gall and assumption that you can just figure everything out on your own.  Google touts all these wonderful features such as a Telephoto Lens and a Super Actual Display (whatever the heck that means), in addition to Artificial Intelligence and then leaves you high and dry as to how to use those features.  Granted, most people can probably figure a lot of it out on their own, but this smartphone is considered by critics to be among the Top 3 phones of the year, which means it has stats and capabilities that far exceed the typical throwaway burner phone.So, help us out a little, will you?  I just spent $1,000.  Why did I spend this much money, to just throw a product at me and then ask me to just figure everything out on my own, or do the work that you should have done for me?  Shame on you, Google!"
5.0,It was easy to set up.  So far everything functions well with no glitches. Battery life is very good.  I get improved calling and texting than my 3XL.  Camera is great.  Would recommend to Android users.
5.0,"I love my new phone! I previously had the Pixel 7 which was my first Google phone and from there on I was thrilled with their operating system, the camera and the editing tools it offers is amazing!Although I am satisfied with the phone not all that glitters is gold. Some negative points of this phone are that, it overheats in certain situations, therefore, its performance drops a bit, connectivity is weak and some applications are not 100% optimized. However, every month Google releases an update for the phone in which it fixes the issues and optimizes the phone.Positive points:- Excellent sound quality.- Amazing screen.- Good battery performance.- Haptic vibration is spectacular.- Incredible camera.- AI brings great value to the phone with several interesting features without the need to download third party apps."
3.0,"This post is about disappointment. Below, I will describe all the problems I faced in a month (a little more) of using the Google Pixel 8 PRO with 256 gigabytes.I'll try my best not to be bitter, but I'm not sure if I'll succeed because I expected something completely different from a $1050 phone.I bought the US version on Amazon. As a pre-order gift with the phone, they offered the Google Pixel Watch 2. In total, all this pleasure cost me $1050. I wasn't particularly interested in the watch and planned to sell them, thereby reducing the overall cost of the phone. In fact, currently on ""Black Friday,"" the phone on the official website costs $859. So, there was no gift in the form of the watch, and I paid for the phone + watch.I consider $350 for the Google Pixel Watch 2 an absurd price because there are many cool watches on the market cheaper.Let's start with the most important: Calls. In ""vibration"" mode, there is no audible notification in TWS headphones. The call volume in the headphones is tied to the ""ring volume"" in the ""sound and vibration"" section. Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I always used the vibrate mode, and I could hear all incoming calls in the headphones. For people who talk a lot on the phone, this will be a very unpleasant moment. This problem extends to all non-Google TWS headsets. Next, take Pixel Buds Pro, connect them to the phone, and encounter the following problem: the audio notifications during incoming calls work only the first 3-4 times, then disappear. You need to disconnect the headset and reconnect it.The side buttons are not tactile.Weak processor. In synthetic tests, the processor delivers 1K. I consider this a very low indicator for a phone that positions itself as a flagship. Currently, it doesn't feel noticeable, but the fact remains. There are Chinese brands that have Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. There, the performance is approximately twice as much. If you are taking a phone for a long time, such a performance indicator is not great.Accessories. No charger and SIM ejector tool. SIM ejector tool, seriously. I opened the SIM card slot with a needle and a door frame catch. I just have no words, only emotions.Battery life. The phone is new and lasts for now. My Xiaomi, which I used for 3 years, held up about the same. If you look at reviews comparing battery life with other phones, it's all sad there.Charging time. My previous Xiaomi phone, bought in 2018, had a 38W charger. Besides being included in the package, it also charged faster.Raw operating system. Approximately 2-3 times a week, I reboot the phone. The notification shade doesn't come down, the button doesn't respond, black screen during incoming calls, and there are just tons of such bugs. To understand how tragic everything is, you need a month with this phone.Rattling. If you shake the phone, you can hear the optics (lens) hitting the phone's body. And this problem is not only on my phone. A friend has the same issue.Speaker sound. It's not bad, but on the iPhone, it's better. More midrange and low frequencies.Wi-Fi problems. Doesn't always want to connect to the access point. No matter what Wi-Fi standard it operates on or the authentication method on the access point. It might disconnect from the access point, might say the password is incorrect. A friend has the same issue. This problem was detected on Mikrotik access points.Well, there are a bunch of downsides, but now I can't remember them.Well, and I want to highlight a couple of positives so it's not all that tragic.Camera. Beautiful photos, very good in night mode. Magic erase is a cool thing. It doesn't always work 100%, but sometimes it really surprises with what AI can do.Conclusion: Before switching to the Google Pixel 8 Pro, I had the Xiaomi Mi 10 Lite 5G. I bought it for $260. For that money, I got an excellent phone that worked flawlessly for 3 years. MIUI shell, in my opinion, is much better than this Android on the Pixel.I'll probably sell the phone. Even if all the software problems are fixed, the impression of the phone is not very good anymore, and I don't want to use it."
4.0,"I upgraded from the pixel 7, first month i had great experience, i didnt even switch screen resolution to Full - Highest mode, because i was worried it would effect already a hot phone even getting hotter, so my experience is with 1080p, so phone is super toasty like all the pixels of course, it has terrible LTE/5G modem (on wifi it works noticably cooler and longer), it drains SO MUCH BATTERY, that im charging my phone 2 times a day,( i use 4G 24hr/7 , because i have unlimited of it, so it's easier rather then switching to wifi back and forth) startng off with 100% 7:00, second cycle is at around 12-1 when it gets down to 20% and then the last at midnight or before the sleep, depends what i plan to do, but if i have to go out of course i should charge it with super slow charging brick, which wasn't even included in the box. so to make it short, i still love the phone especially after my problem with  hating on the Pixel overprocessed photos got solved with the new manual mode+raw, only stuff to improve is efficiency, makephone cooler(bc when it gets hot it's making experience super unpleasant, its like scrolling through the menu with a 2 y.o. samsung flagship that is having micro lags everywhere, lol ) with a great battery, plus would love to see higher wattage charging support such as 50w+ , and also if you love to play some graphically intensive games, this thing handles ok, but not in the terms of ""very well"" .Now the good part i really loved after switching from the 7 is the MUCH brighter screen , better ultrawide and a telephoto lens, which is pretty good! for me this  things were such a deal breakers that i decided to upgrade from it.There is no perfect phone ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
5.0,"I used to buy Motorola phones because they were the closest to unadorned Android you could get.  Now I buy the Pixel phones and enjoy them.  It always seems to be able to connect even in a rural environment and is a decent performer in terms of speed and cripness of response.  The display is excellent, very sharp."
5.0,"I love this phone - the display is fantastic and very bright.  Easy to see, even in the brightest conditions.  The display is made by Samsung, which makes displays for other brands, including the Apple iPhone  I like the pure Android interface, direct from Google with no manufacturer front-end tweaks.  The battery life is so-so.  This brings me to the only thing I don't like:  there is no automatic battery protection, meaning that it doesn't stop charging until 100%.  My previous phone (a Samsung) had this feature, it could be set to stop charging at 85%, which protects the battery.  I use Battery Alarm PRO as a workaround to alert me when the charging reaches a certain point.  This works fine, but I miss the automatic cutoff.  That being said, I would definitely buy the phone again for its display, camera, and AI features."
4.0,"Dise√±o maravilloso, la calidad en fotograf√≠a en sin duda superior, con un software realmente optimizado, limpio y fluido, pero  no es tan potente y la bater√≠a no es suficiente para todo el d√≠a. Muchas funciones de IA sin embargo pocas veces se usan, pienso que por un poco menos de dinero seria perfecto."
5.0,"Phone does what phone is supposed to do, I hope the Android 15 addresses many of the bugs experienced with Android 14. Camera is fantastic, performance is okay, for the price I expected the phone to be more snappy, but I like it better than my older pixel phones so that is an improvement."
5.0,"I was kind of forced to upgrade from my Pixel 6 Pro because I dropped it one too many times on the curve, it broke into too many little pieces, and then dropped it again after a few months and the screen flashed brown, still works but not useable. I love that the Pixel 8 Pro can take close up pictures, and doesn't have a curved screen. The curved screen looked nice but it made my phone crack easily, so I'm hoping this phone will last a lot longer than that one did. I'm also happy I got this phone with a discount on here, Verizon sells it at full price, and it came fast."
4.0,"Switched from a Samsung S20FE to the Pixel 8 Pro, 256GB (unlocked). Menues and swipes are a bit different but the transition has not been bad. No issues swapping SIM card with Xfinity service. Data transfer was easy and done wirelessly. The screen is great and camera is top notch, but the camera does protrude from the back about 1/8"" for the lenses. Finger print reader has been good and better than the Samsung which constantly got stuck in touch protection mode. The battery life is so-so for the price, but I have not used the battery optimization yet. It does seem to charge faster than the S20. Still adapting to an all-Google way, so not sure if there is some mild bugginess or user error or both. I also have a '22 Volvo with Google controls. The Pixel seems to interface better with the car than the S20, but I'm still working on getting that all dialed in. I do wish the Pixel had expandable memory. Im guessing the hi-res camera and video can eat up 256GB pretty quicky. I'm sure Google will be happy to store my stuff in the cloud, for yet another small montly fee in my life."
4.0,"I upgraded from the Pixel 6. Aside from the enhanced zoom and magic editor it doesn't feel that much better. Yes, the zoom is awesome, and so is the editor. But, for my purposes, this doesn't feel like enough of a leap forward to merit the 'upgrade'. Don't get me wrong, it's a great phone, but you've got a Pixel 6 or 7, and don't need the 30x zoom or magic editor, it might be worth waiting to see what comes next."
4.0,"Edit:So after a few updates from Google and about 3 months this of use, the Pixel 8 Pro seems to have stabilized. The updates release by Google has resolved the rebooting that used to happen multiple times a day. It now only randomly restarts once every month or so, which is a massive improvement. Other than that, the phone is back to being usable and normal. In terms of the Pixel 8's capabilities, it's a great phone and does what it needs to do, and does so well. It's no Snapdragon 3 but it's more than enough for 95% of tasks.Original Review:It only takes the Pixel 8 Pro to turn excitement into despair. The phone randomly reboots itself multiple times a day for no reason. After going through multiple forums and even Google‚Äôs own community channel, it seems like it‚Äôs a common problem that the manufacturer either refuses to acknowledge or just doesn‚Äôt care about resolving it. For this particular phone of mine, it reboots multiple times a day for no apparent reason and without any indication as to why.My advice‚Ä¶ spend your hard earned money elsewhere."
4.0,Quality phone which feels very good in the hand. Very good camera
4.0,"Initially I had trouble with the Wi-Fi, constantly connecting, disconnecting and then not wanting to connect. I discovered that the phone has an issue connecting to Wi-Fi access that are configured 160 MHz wide channels. After reconfiguring my access point to an 80 MHz wide channel the Wi-Fi has worked perfectly. Initially I also had trouble with gestures and had to figure out how to turn on the triangle circle square buttons at the bottom of the screen. I did not find gestures very intuitive or the feature wasn't working as advertised. The battery life is excellent. Much better than my previous Pixel 4XL, I would say about double the life. I need to play around a bit more with the camera to see how well the camera works. The photos I've taken so far have looked very good. Overall I have been pleased with the phone other than the initial issues with the Wi-Fi, which I hope Google resolves with a future update, and my troubles with gestures."
5.0,Received in great condition and working as expected. Very happy with the purchase!
2.0,"Heads up that I am posting this review a fourth time after it was removed by Amazon.  This could mean that the seller is attempting to remove bad reviews of this phone, but I cannot be sure.  Here is the email I received:""Thank you for submitting a review of Google Pixel 8 Pro - Unlocked Android Smartphone with Telephoto Lens and Super Actua Display - 24-Hour Battery - Bay - 512 GB; we are sorry you did not have a positive experience. We investigated your concerns about product authenticity, and the information we have indicates that the product you received was authentic. As a result, we removed the review you submitted. This ensures that customer reviews remain as accurate as possible for the benefit of future customers.""The color range and depth of the Pixel 8 Pro is remarkably bad.  I have seen better screens on $200 phones, and I'm not making knee-jerk exaggerations about it.  I really want to love this phone, and I do love most other aspects of it.  But for some reason, Google decided to put a screen on it that's so bad, I wouldn't trust that I'm taking good photos until I saw them on another phone or a computer display.I understand that this is a bold claim, so let me prove what I'm saying in photos.  In each photo, the Pixel 8 Pro is on the left, and a OnePlus 7t is on the right, both at 100% brightness.  The photos were taken with a OnePlus 8t.  Keep in mind that these are photos of screens, and cameras aren't fully representative of what we see.  Additionally, screens emit some light that gets picked up by cameras that we cannot see, and you (the reader) are looking at these photos through yet another screen.  Regardless, I believe that these photos do a satisfactory job of displaying the the poor color range of the 8 Pro.I included three photos of a website displaying pure primary colors (red, green, and blue), and included one more photo of an image that displays a range of colors.  Both of these phones use OLED displays, so the ""red"" areas contain pixels where only the red subpixels are at 100% brightness, while the blue and green subpixels are fully off, for example.  I verified this on both devices firsthand with a jeweler's loupe, just to be sure.  Primary colors are supposed to be ""pure"" colors, meaning that the ""red"" photo is the phone attempting to produce the most ""red"" color it can, for example.I really don't need to explain much more, since the photos deliver some pretty solid justice.  Notice that the red especially looks like tomato paste on the Pixel 8 Pro while they look like ""pure red"" on the 7t.  And the blues and greens of a ""good"" OLED screen almost look ""fake"" from so much color, but again, this is with the primary subpixels of their respective color on full brightness, so the ""redder"" the red is, the better the color depth of the red is.  Additionally, dark colors on the 8 Pro are much too bright and washed out.Needless to say, it's lousy.  What was Google thinking?  I am so disappointed in the screen, that I'm returning the phone on this basis alone.  I am distracted by the screen quality anytime I use the phone for any occasion.  Returning to my 7t feels like a breath of fresh air.  This screen simply should not be sold on a ~$1k device."
5.0,"Muy bonito y buen telefono, llego en perfectas condiciones y hasta ahora no encuentro fallos en su funcionamiento, esperemos que las actualizaciones duren lo que dicen"
5.0,This phone has been awesome. It has some very unique features that are very helpful. And overall it's been great so far.
4.0,"It's a great phone over all ,however Google and Google assistant, are so incredibly glitchy on here. It's frustrating honestly. I also thought the camera was going to be a lot better. It's still better then the iPhone I had before but I'm not as in love with it as I thought I would be. That is largely because it's not user friendly. I'm pretty savvy tech wise, so that is saying something. The quality is good, not great. I'm still chasing the photo quality of that one Samsung I had back in '08."
5.0,Phone is great and came in great condition.
4.0,"Edit: Once OS optimizations were made (disabling rcs in messages is a big one), battery performance went to about 1 week from last charge. It's becoming less laggy, presumably due to caching.Turn off auto lens selector to improve camera speed from seconds to take a pic, to nanoseconds.-1 star for size.I bought this phone because Google stopped security upgrades for Pixel 4.First thing I noticed is how stuttery and laggy the interface, and the apps are compared to P4. My friends who have P8P also experienced this. Battery life is abysmal, despite having almost double the size battery compared to P4.Camera app is quirky. Taking a photo with flash takes 2-3 seconds, whereas it's instant on P4. Some gimmicky AI features that also take a while to ""process."" Hopefully, this is a software issue, and not poor design. I miss using my Pixel 4...Minor:Size is unwieldy."
4.0,"Face detect great for unlockMany functions which I haven't figured out how to use, and the YouTube tutorials are not very helpful. So I am stuck at a low level of features which the phone offers.This is no my first Pixel phone. I have Pixel 3 and 6 and have been happy with them.On another subject: the battery life is impressive."
5.0,Phone is really good.And it's android it clean without a lot of visual stuff that consumes memory
4.0,"Overall the phone feels very premium, good build quality, a really nice soft-touch glass back and a stunning flat display, phone feels snappy but you can notice lags in some apps (e.g. Telegram, YouTube, VK, etc.) as well as battery drain when on mobile data connection, for example today I got 5:30h of SoT (LTE-only in my case, haven't tested 5G). And the most concerning thing is that the phone is warm to touch even during simplest tasks (messaging, web browsing). Camera features are amazing, I have been using the phone for a week now and still haven't tried a half of all features available :D. Overall rating: 4/5 (deducted for battery life, SoC performance and thermals)"
5.0,"Overall, the Google Pixel 8 Pro stands out as a flagship smartphone that excels in every aspect, from its stunning display and powerful performance to its exceptional camera capabilities and premium design. It's a device that pushes the boundaries of what a smartphone can do, setting a new standard for excellence in the industry."
4.0,"I'm still getting used to the smaller size but I'm enjoying the phone. I bought it for the camera, high resolution screen and the dual sim option. Both the camera and the screen are fantastic!  The dual sim works. I can get calls/texts from both numbers at the same time, but I was hoping I could control calls/texts from the different numbers individually. For example, to turn do not disturb on my work phone while still allowing calls from my personal. Unfortunately it doesn't work like that."
5.0,El mejor tel√©fono que he tenido.
5.0,"I really like this phone for what it is. Google has been doing a lot with their AI features, and I'm here for it. I'm a tech guy that doesn't buy into the Apple fan club, so Google is the obvious alternative. Samsung is okay, too, but I don't love their bloatware apps.Anyway, the features are nice, and battery life is improved over last gen Pixel. I really really like the satin glass back, compared to last year's glossy finish.I will be honest here, though, if you're already running the 7 Pro, it's likely not worth the upgrade. They didn't change a whole heck of a lot between the two generations from what I can see. Maybe wait and see what they do with the 9 next year."
5.0,"Don't freak out if you see a little hole in the front by the camera you did not break it. Love this phone and the camera on it is amazing!I HAD to snap this sunset because it was unreal!! So this picture was taken while driving and very quickly, yet it came out PERFECT!! I was so happy to capture this"
4.0,The Pixels are great phones but they are not my cup of tea. If you like their feature set then go for it. You won't be disappointed.
3.0,I don't know if I'm just used to Samsung or what but this phone sucks. The battery life is 6 hours tops. (NOT great for traveling!) It's practically impossible to intentionally see all open tabs at once. I just have to keep trying until I accidentally perform whatever magical operation makes it work. I will say the facial recognition unlock is stupid fast and easy. The fingerprint reader does not work in the dark though.I came from a Z Fold 4 that may or may not be repaired. I was told the camera on this phone was exceptional but I have not experienced that yet.  I think I'm going to return this and go back to my old Note 9 until I can afford a Samsung again.
5.0,"I'm really really pleased with the pixel 8 pro.Pros:Battery life, screen, cameras, AI features are out of this world, little extras from Google, ie 6 months of Google 1, seriously the list of pros go on and on... the cameras I have to give another mention to. The stability and quality and features are all superior to any others I've tried.  Even better than my wife's s22+ that cost more.Support was responseive and helpful when I had a setup question via chat.Cons: very picky to find any. Fingerprint unlock is a little weak compared to Samsung flagships. Face unlock seems to turn access to the camera off occasionally. I assume that'll fix in an update but even if not, no biggie.The temperature sensor is almost cool but just comes off too gimmicky. It's not accurate enough for anything serious. I would have rather they put something else here. Like maybe a pulse checker or improved the fingerprint reader with the budget spent on this. These are small complaints though. It's amazing overall."
4.0,"Performance is alright but given the Tensor chip lags behind the latest snapdragon, the price doesn't really make sense. Charging is fast which is to be expected from a flagship, though it will throttle if the battery gets too hot which is good but seems to happen more than other phones I've had in the past. Screen looks lovely and battery life is amazing even when gaming for hours. Sound quality could be better, sounds about what you'd expect from a midrange Samsung device. Lastly the camera is amazing, video recording is clear and stable, call quality crisp, and AI features plentiful.Tldr: if you're just looking to stay snug in the Android ecosystem with guaranteed updates and future hardware support via ifixit, then the pixel is a safe bet. If you are mobile gamer then look elsewhere as the gaming performance is lacking with Tensor 3."
4.0,"Not bad, but far from the iPhone, I'm talking about cameras and performance and battery. But the night photos here are great"
4.0,"My new pixel 8 pro is a great phone. However, it has one ""unAndroid-like"" flaw. The home screen has the day and date in the upper left hand corner which cannot be removed. It is fixed in both size and location. Unfortunately, the size is small. I added a clock widget to the home screen which allows for a larger clock, day and date. Now I have redundancy, which I don't like. Being an Android phone, I would expect to be able to completely modify my home screen.I got a great price on this phone and delivery was flawless. It's all good except for this one frustrating feature."
4.0,I don't use a screen protector so I'm used to minor scratches on the screen. But after 2 months it looks just like my Galaxy s21 I had for almost 3 years. Quite disappointing. Other than that it's a phone ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
3.0,"I bought this thinking this would be a great purchase for the next years. I was super happy with my previous smart phone (OnePlus 5) and don't feel this Pixel will come as close to the performance i had with the previous one.Cons- Battery lasts day and a half, so that will only decrease. Dont think it will be able to live the 7 year service promised by google.- You can't customise the default launcher- Chunkier than expected. The phone does not have a weigh balance, camara side is way heavier and that makes holding the phone (i.e. video watching) a pain, since your index fingers will hold more weight than your palm/thumb.- Back button does not work properly at times, specially when the phone is lying horizontally- You cant mirror a picture with the default apps.Pros:- Good camara- 7 Year service/update promiseOverall, i would not buy this phone again nor recommend for the price."
5.0,"So far, I love this phone. It has lots of useful new features my Pixel 5 didn't have, a wonderful camera with a 5x optical zoom lens, and an OLED screen that is incredibly bright and clear. It ain't cheap, but it does cost less than some of the other high-end phones out there. I am not a fan of Apple, and prefer Android phones. So this one fits the bill. If it proves to be sturdy and lasts several years, I will be totally satisfied."
5.0,"Pros:- super bright and vibrant screen, smooth scrolling and effects are very pleasant- photo and video is amazing (given the existing optics). My wife's iPhone 15 Pro Max takes rest when we both are getting out- I love the design and flat(finally), with smooth edges screen. Using dbrand micro grip case with it- Holiday prices are unbeatable. Got 1TB version with 200 bucks of MSRP- Pure Linux experience w/o add ons.Cons:- They could have drop off the SIM slot and added battery capacity, to extend battery life by 20% or even more- Still using Samsung chip aka ""Tensor"". It drains more power, but given the extended and speedy RAM, the Linux (that's what Android is) is still slow- GPU drivers glitches cause some delays during transformations. Especially seen during AutorotationOther thoughts:I hooked up on Pixel 8 Pro. It was the love from the first sight. The best phone you can get for money."
5.0,"This replaces a Pixel 6 Pro and it's a very nice upgrade. The performance has been excellent. I'm not one to run benchmarking tests so my impression is based on normal usage, and I find the performance to be snappy and smooth. The screen is outstanding -- bright and clear, and readable even in direct sunlight (unlike my past Pixel phones).While the hardware specs, the cameras and the AI features are important, what sealed the deal for me was Google's support for Android and security updates for 7 years. I expect to keep this phone for some time, and the extended support/update window is a real plus that adds value.So far zero problems. 100% satisfied with the phone -- five stars."
4.0,"Everything great about the phone, but I wish the phone case had a grippy textured surface. I really didn't want a case, but kept slipping from my pocket and hand. I'm ready on my phones and don't like cases. Regrettably had to get a case which makes it much thicker."
5.0,Great camera and not too heavy.
5.0,
5.0,"It's a beautiful phone, good price and what I wanted."
5.0,"Gran equipo, la mejor c√°mara del mercado por lejos, muy fluido y gran dise√±o"
4.0,I used to use this phone with no issue
4.0,"It‚Äôs a good product, but compared with iPhone, a little heavier difficult to use at beginning."
5.0,Love this Smartphone. It is truly smart. Screen is super!Google One VPN is worth the small yearly cost!I have not had it long but I am very happy I chose it.Fantastic 30X Zoom! Four cameras!Too many features to learn all at once. New free ones in the works.support.google.com/pixelphone/ is excellent. Better than most by a long shot.Google has already sent a couple of free updates.Google supports the Smartphone for seven years.
3.0,"Los efectos de propaganda no son tan pros en realidad.Voice Google no funciona tambi√©n como deber√≠a por ser de √∫ltima generaci√≥n y de Google.La c√°mara super desprotegida.Nada de espacio en la pantalla principal, te obliga a tener la barra de b√∫squeda de Google y el clima siempre."
3.0,"It's ok. Took absolutely forever to transfer everything from my pixel 7 to this 8 pro. Literal hours. That's the biggest annoyance with h android ( life long iPhone user before this) updates take forever and so does transfers even pixel to pixel. And the settings say 60-120hz. Not 1-120hz like advertised. Also I went to use the photo editor features this photo was advertised with and it says ""some editing tools need to o be installed. Connect to WiFi to start installing"" so I had to wait hours before even being able to use the few features of the 8 series.Overall just a very second class experience coming from an iPhone in my opinion. Google just gives half effort again and again. Finger print reader is also hit or miss as well.-STILL GETS REALLY HOT-FINGERPRINT READER IS HIT OR MISS-FACE UNLOCK DOSNT WORK IN ANY LOW LIGHT SITUATIONNOT WORTH THE FULL MSRP NOT EVEN CLOSEWAIT FOR THIS  TO GO ON SALE BEFORE BUYING. DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS PHONE."
5.0,"For the last three years I been using iPhone and not liking them too much. Yes they're very premium and fast but the Os lack the customizing options to truly make you feel like the phone you bought is you own. Once I learned that google was about to launch the pixel 8 pro and the new color Bay, I told myself this is my chance to make the switch and boy the Bay version is really a thing of beauty. Performance in everyday tasks are fast and smooth( except for gaming in 3d). I am not much of a camera guy but this device does blow my 13 pro max out the water. Battery life been very good for me. Yes I do charge it twice a day to close  full charge but there are days that I'll forget to bring a charger with me and the phone still lasted till the end of the day with at least 30% left. This device might not be for those that like to have insane screen on time or "" power users"". Over all this is my ideal device. The snappy Os and built quality/device color really is top notch. I really like my purchase!"
5.0,"IMO it's the best phone available. Most new phones don't bring too much innovation to the table, but this phone does with all its AI features. I've been using it for three months now and I couldn't be more happy.I super love the AI features for the photos."
5.0,"I've been an iPhone user since 2018 or so. This most recent Pixel has finally convinced me to ditch the fruit company (especially after the horrific launch of the iPhone 15) and i'm having a really hard time looking back.The battery life is... just okay. Using things like spotify or maps eats up the battery but I can still make it a full day with about 30% left.The display is wonderful, the adaptive refresh rate absolutely saves Android's somewhat juttery experience.And the camera. Oh my, the camera. I've attached two photos i've taken using it's portrait mode with no altercations or adjustments in post, and it's simply incredible.If you've got the money to spend, this is the android to get."
5.0,"Upgraded from Pixel 5 to Pixel 8 pro... HUGE difference. Phone is fast, battery lasts all day and charges to full in 30 min with 30w charger bought seperately, I read lots of people saying its too big for one handed use but I am over 6' tall and feel that the size is perfect, best part is the continous improvements and support for the next 7 years, some people also said it gets hot, it did for me when i opened it using for setup but has not happened again since except on the charger so nothing abnormal, I also love the front finger print scanner and face unlock, great buy for anyone!"
4.0,"The phone is very good looking and feels great holding in hands. However, the heating is really bad. 20 minutes on youtube and I can feel the edge being noticeably hotter than my hands. Battery life is decent, but I can tell the battery will not last long. I had to return it and get an iphone."
5.0,I've been a pixel user for years now and really liked the pro 8
5.0,"Es un tel√©fono espectacular pero vale la pena si lo consigues con descuento, a precio base puede ser que quieras compararlo con otros tel√©fonos de la misma gamma."
4.0,Overall very good.I have large hands and still find this phone to be large and cumbersome to use.
3.0,"Battery life:The Pixel 8 Pro's battery life is the most inconsistent variable in the phone. I got 5 hours of SOT that landed me on 68 percent, but the next day it was 2 hours of SOT with 47 percent by the end of the day. The phone while being used has great battery life, but the idle consumption with 5G on kills the phone super fast. Yes this is the reason why its only three stars.fingerprint reader:The fingerprint reader is great on this phone, and it has a night-and-day difference after coming from the Pixel 6, but the screen protector that I got made it very inconsistent. (not the phone's fault)Value for money:The Pixel 8 pro features are gimmicks that don't justify the price difference from the normal Pixel 8 so go for the normal 8 and save some money."
3.0,"No matter how hard I try, I'm getting no notifications from twitter no matter what. I easily received notifications from all my other phones except this one. First time getting google pixel. Camera quality is good, and no lag while gaming, but this one defect really upset me :("
3.0,"Phone has a bright screen, great camera and is very responsive. But it has artificial intelligence and they should capitalize the word artificial because the phone's constantly trying to get ahead of you. And you have a lot of pop-up ads and stuff happening that you really don't need. For instance, the microphone doesn't turn off when you quit talking so anything in the background gets recorded. It just really actually takes some getting used to. This is not your your Grandad's Android. This is an Android on steroids. I'm going to give it some time."
5.0,Hasta ahora todo de maravilla. Vale lo que pagas!
5.0,"Been using Google phones since the beginning, I usually use them until they no longer support security updates usually around the years, no unwanted apps or bloat, I've always payed full price to avoid the financing option and have never had insurance, these phone are pretty tough."
2.0,"Things I like:-$800 good price-7 years of support-fantastic camera system-great battery life-speakers sound goodThings I dont like-no sd card slot-audio source switcher nonexistant-cant customize navigation buttons-changing the brightness is a hassle-gallery app is mega garbage; cant sort or group photos, cant nest folders, cant change cover photo of album, cant change size of thumbnails, cant sort by media type-phone is making random calls without input and playing audio in the bg with no apps openI've come from using Samsungs for nearly the past decade and decided to switch it up since Im not really fond of what Samsung is doing with their latest phones. The stock Android experience is just awful, and feels like an iPhone with how pittle customization and control you have. Now I can hear you through the screen saying ,""just root your phone and do what you want."" No, I should not have to go through hoops to have features that I have become accustomed to. It feels like Google put way too much time and effort into the AI features that I am not reaply going to ever use and forgot all about the things that make a phone pleasant to use. We as a society have severely reduced our expectations and accepted that ""things just are"", but I promise you that they aren't, and we can vote with our wallets to make a substantial difference."
3.0,Cannot individualize text notifications. Other features are a lot more difficult to find or navigate. Not what I expected from a fairly expensive phone. My old Samsung was much much easier. The only reason I gave a 3 star rating was because of the camera and software.
3.0,"I have had a Pixel ever since the first one, also brought them for our IT users. I love how my entire digital life is tied together. I also loved every time an Apple user was complaining that they had to delete photos to back up their phone.  This was not an issue with Pixel because Pixel had free photo storage until now.  So I upgraded to a Pixel pro and lost my free photo backups, which really sucks.  I will probably start using OneDrive since 1terabite is included in most office packages."
5.0,"Definitely a flagship phone, love the power, secure face unlock, front finger print reader, cameras...I haven't found a use for the temperature sensor, it's kind of a gimmick and too many steps to use.It's too precious to use without a case, which hides the color of the phone, maybe some day I'll change to a clear caseIt's a bit on the spendy side. I got it right when I came out, and got a free Google Watch 2 with it, which I don't like (review under that item). I kinda hate spending this much money on a phone, but at least it's cheaper than an iPhone."
5.0,"Grabbed it on sale and thoroughly impressed!! Very intuitive and has all the features I want and more, glad I got rid of my S23 Ultra"
5.0,This phone fast.
3.0,"I have always assumed pixel phones had the best cameras. This one was not noticeably better than my s22, but it still very good.Build quality seems good and the shade of blue was pleasing.However, I had to factory reset this thing three times in four weeks. I also routinely lost functionality requiring reboot. I'm going to assume it'll get better, but didn't want to bet that purchase price on it.AI features were excellent, loved the texting options."
2.0,"Replaced my four-year-old PXL 4 that I paid $220 for.Pros: Camera, screen brightness, processor.Cons: PXL 8 Pro is a little larger than it had to be. When set to show display by touching screen or picking it up, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The touch screen has nowhere near the accuracy and sensitivity of my PXL 4, this is even more important with the additional screen real estate and even less understandable considering the price difference. Moving the fingerprint sensor to the front was a bonehead idea in my opinion. Less user friendly and more difficult to use with a screen protector and easier to drop. The first phone I received wouldn't even recognize my print through a screen protector, even after setting the phone for higher sensitivity and the phone had accepted the print. The replacement phone worked.Insufficient upgrades over a four-year-old model to be classified as a ""flagship,"" and cons that should have been eliminated in R&D before the phone was released is inexcusable. Especially for a phone costing at least three times as much as a model from four years ago when you factor in inflation."
5.0,Works great so far. Easy transfer from my old phone so set up was not an issue the phone walks you thru the steps.
5.0,"I've had a good experience with battery life considering I'm not such a demanding user. The camera quality is amazing, I love the screen brightness in outdoors."
5.0,"The Google Pixel 8 Pro is a flagship smartphone that excels in every aspect. From its camera prowess to its high-performance hardware, the device delivers on its promise of providing a top-tier mobile experience. A smartphone that combines cutting-edge technology with an exceptional camera system, the Google Pixel 8 Pro is undoubtedly a compelling choice that stands out in the crowded smartphone market."
5.0,Bought this one because the unlocked pixel 7pro crapped out on me after just a year so as long as that doesn't happen again I'll stay happy. It's a great phone with a great camera
5.0,Upgraded to the 8Pro from my Galaxy. The battery life is miles above what the Galaxy ever was. The Pixel is fast and I love the color.
5.0,This phone does everything you could expect a phone to do and much more. It does so many things it takes a while to learn everything and the you find even more features. Unbelievable camera and photo editor
5.0,"After a lot of missed marks, this phone finally made the wife happy! No longer i have to endure the days of ""This camera is bad"" and ""battery doesn't last much"".Sorry if I don't offer a more in depth review, but I don't care for cell phones much. I do appreciate the peace it brought to our home!"
5.0,I haven't had the phone long. I love everything about the phone. I'm still learning all the features and tricks..so far so good
5.0,Absolutely love the Pixel line and the Pixel 8 Pro is awesome! The camera is way better than on my old Samsung. Speed is good and battery life has been good so far. Bonus is that you can use the built-in eSIM and put another SIM in the tray... 2 phone number on one phone!
5.0,"Was time, past time really, to get new phones. Picked ‚Äúgeneric‚Äù Pixel 8 Pro for several reasons.  Not tied to any phone carrier. I like that!  Camera is excellent, phone size is a little bigger than I need, but, is not too big.  Reasonable size and still fits nicely in your hand and/or pocket/purse.  No extra apps.  Very configurable. Sometimes a little too configurable, but, lots of documentation to help you.  Lastly, I really like Google‚Äôs 8-year promise for updates.  I do not change phones often.  Old phones were Samsung S9s."
5.0,Went from LG to Google. Took a little while to get used to the differences but I think I'm loving it. It has great photos and it stands up to how much I use my phone. I'm just hoping it will last 3 years like the LG phone did.
4.0,Good phone nice features but overpriced
4.0,"Coming from a Google Pixel 7 pro, I must say the screen is outstanding... The interface feels faster than the pixel 7 pro. I absolutely love the phone. Bay all the way... üòä"
3.0,I had some hairline scratches and those cause a lot of screen breakings. I hope not a lot of other used phones are not like that.
3.0,"I used the Galaxy S20FE before using the Pixel 8pro.I wouldn't have bought it if they hadn't given me the Pixel watch 2.The Pixel has finally taken shape as a phone.There are many things that need to be fixed in the future, such as software bugs, support for folders on the app item screen instead of the front screen, and the back of the phone burning when charging wirelessly.However, looking into the future, it appears that a normal mobile phone will be released in about 5 years and will take a large share of Galaxy's market share.Work harder, Pixel managers!from a korean person"
5.0,"Omg, I'm so glad I waited for this phone. I originally purchased a 7 and the battery life was trash. I returned it and decided to wait to see if Google would fix that issue. And yes they did! So glad they did, am completely satisfied with my purchase and it came with the watch. Pairs seamlessly with the buds and watch!"
1.0,"Viaje a Estados Unidos en octubre, aprovechando el viaje, quer√≠a comprar un Pixel 7 Pro. Me encontr√© con la oferta de lanzamiento del Pixel 8 Pro y el Pixel watch 2, al volver a mi Pa√≠s, note que mi tel√©fono no conectaba a la Red 5G, consulte con el operador y este me dijo que  el Pixel 8 Pro es compatible con los servicios 5G de la red. Al consultar en la p√°gina de Google, confirme que, efectivamente, el tel√©fono es compatible, pero es Google, quien decide inhabilitar esta tecnolog√≠a (Por la cual pague), en pa√≠ses donde el tel√©fono no tiene venta oficial. Lo que es peor, vienen con esta pr√°ctica desde el Pixel 4 5G. Un mal chiste. Hubiese devuelto el tel√©fono de inmediato de haber contado con la informaci√≥n. Amazon deber√≠a activamente advertir a los compradores viajeros para minimizar las malas experiencias.En cuanto al Pixel Watch 2 y sus funciones de salud no son nada versus a las de samsung y su Galaxy Watch, Google te cobra por todo, incluso limita el uso de las funciones del reloj en otros pa√≠ses.Traducido con bardI traveled to the United States in October, and I wanted to take advantage of the trip to buy a Pixel 7 Pro. I found the launch offer for the Pixel 8 Pro and the Pixel Watch 2. When I returned to my country, I noticed that my phone could not connect to the 5G network. I consulted with my carrier, and they told me that the Pixel 8 Pro is compatible with the carrier's 5G services. When I consulted Google's website, I confirmed that the phone is indeed compatible, but Google decides to disable this technology (for which I paid) in countries where the phone is not officially sold. What's worse, they have been doing this since the Pixel 4 5G. It's a bad joke. I would have returned the phone immediately if I had had the information. Amazon should actively warn traveling buyers to minimize bad experiences.As for the Pixel Watch 2 and its health features, they are nothing compared to Samsung's Galaxy Watch. Google charges you for everything, even limiting the use of the watch's features in other countries."
4.0,Good
5.0,"Had it for 2-3 days now and I really only bought it for the feedback I've seen on the camera.  Here's a pic I took yesterday.  I'm really happy with it.Btw, there a NO enhancements on this picture... I thought about adding some but it just doesn't need it."
1.0,"I really wanted to love this phone, but I cannot recommend it based on my poor experience. I don't know if I received a defective example or if there is a bigger quality issue. When I received my phone I proceeded with the usual setup and data transfer from my old Samsung. All the apps moved over without a hitch, but the transfer failed on moving over my pictures. There was nothing that worked, not even a hard reset would make it happen. I did not want to download apps to do it so the option was to download my pictures to Google drive and then to the phone. The issue is, Google only gives you so much space for free before you have to pay and mine was filling up fast, to the point that now Google was asking me to pay for more storage. Not good, and I am wondering if this is a ploy to make more money... Other problems continued to happen as well. The screen rotate function would not work even though the functions were turned on. The screen lock wake up to touch would not work even when the function was turned on. The camera app would be slow to engage to take a photo, literally 3-5 second delay before you could take a photo. Sometimes the camera app would open, but then close for no apparent reason. Google maps would stop responding when a route selected, literally no response to touch whatsoever. A hard reset would fix one or the other issue, but not all. Another hard reset would again fix one issue, but not the other. I contacted Google support, but all they could offer is another hard reset or a replacement under warranty, but they could not guarantee if the phone would be brand new or refurbished. I decided to return my Pro 8 and have no choice but try my luck with another device. Wanted to love my Pro 8, but it left me disappointed."
5.0,Took longer than stated but it finally reached and I'm in live with it. Good purchase üëåüèæ
5.0,This is by far the best phone I've had! I still find new things for it every day!
5.0,"I am in love with this phone. It was so easy to set up, I used Smart-Switch. This phone is the most responsive smart phone I've ever had. It easily connected to my Bluetooth devices. I've always had Samsung phones, this one is so much better. If you're looking for a new phone, I highly recommend Google Pixel."
