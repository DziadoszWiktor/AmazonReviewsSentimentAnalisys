5.0,"Yes!! I FINALLY found a NON-BELGIAN waffle maker! WHO decided that we ALL had to make only BELGIAN waffles?!  I spent HOURS looking at hundreds of waffle irons and every stinking one of them was for Belgian-style waffles! What the heck?!I like thinner, crispier waffles, with more and smaller holes, MUCH better than the Belgian style. I like to make and freeze a couple dozen of them and then heat them in my regular toaster, when needed. They come out really good, and can also easily be made crispy.I had the same make and model waffle maker as this one, decades ago, that one of my kids ended up taking. This new one seems to be be a little flimsier but it makes good waffles. And it also still has the reversible plates so it can be used as a sandwich grill and as a double griddle if the lid is laid all the way back, flat.I took both of the plates off and washed them, first. A fair amount of smoke still comes out from behind the plates, the first time or two it gets heated, so don't panic. This is non-stick so I did not use any oil or cooking spray and the finished waffles came out very easily, with no residue left behind, at all.It's not the highest quality but it looks like it will last well-enough. I am forgiving every minor fault, because it makes NON-Belgian waffles!"
5.0,This is my 3rd waffle iron in 50 years. I have tried other but keep coming back to the black and decker. It heat more evenly and the waffle are crisp and browned to just the right color. Takes less time to heat up.my only problem with them is the hinge spread over time. I mean over 5 or ten years. They have never stopped working but kind just got old. So i have had to replace them. Over all a good product.
1.0,"Well, I must say that when I ordered this, I thought it looked like a good design. After receiving the unit, I found it to be reminiscent, no, exactly like appliance designs from the 1960s or '70s. I have over 40 years experience in the technology world, and this thing is jaw dropping. If I could, I'd rate zero stars. If you read nothing else here, then jump to the last paragraph.Here are my observations:The unit is not UL certified, but ETL certified (look it up). I'm not saying that's bad, but I've never seen ETL certification before for a kitchen electric.The unit's temperature control depends on the lower grill plate pressing down on a spring-loaded metal box in which the thermostat and temperature control are located. The fit between the lower plate and the unit's base is secure only when the front lower clip secures the plate in place. The temperature control knob connects to the thermostat box via a metal shaft, the rotation of which is rough and notchy. This technology is ancient. More to the point, it allows easy access to the internal works when the machine is connected to power, though I'm reasonably sure adequate insulation is present.The same applies to the upper grill plate. It's fit with the upper housing is also loose and is secure only when the upper latch is in place. Both of these plates are reversible between a flat smooth surface and a waffle iron surface. Each surface has a tab that serves as a drain when using the flat surface for cooking things such as bacon (more about that later).I tested this unit with an infrared thermometer, something everyone should have for checking oven and refrigerator temperatures, and other things as well. They work by pointing a laser at a surface, and the infrared sensor immediately registers the temperature that displays from far below 0 degrees F. to above 500 degrees F. Available at major retail outlets such as Amazon and Home Depot for less than $40.When the temp control is set to High, and the unit heats to the point where the front light turns off, I measured temperatures on the exposed plate edges at the center of the unit exceeding 480 degrees F. The plate edges are exposed on all four sides. As there is no thermal insulation between the upper or lower heating elements and the outside surfaces, the outside surfaces also get quite hot, though not nearly as hot as the plates. Temps on those surfaces registered about 143 degrees maximum.The only safe places to touch the unit while in operation are the large and robust plastic handles. They remained cool to the touch.I cooked waffles, bacon, and an egg.The waffles came out pretty good. Two batches were cooked, and they were just about perfect. The results will vary based on the batter you make, I think.For the bacon, it's a different story. Using the directions in the supplied instructions, I was to cook the bacon for 9-12 minutes on Hign with the lid closed. I placed three strips on the lower plate, closed the lid, and set my timer for three minutes. After three minutes, I lifted the lid to see all three bacon strips stuck to it. I removed the strips and drained on a paper towel. They had an odd appearance in that they had hardly shrunk, but were obviously overcooked; to the point that, when picked up, they shattered.The single egg I cooked, lid up, came out fine, but it did stick a bit to the lower plate at one spot in spite of using oil.After all three items, the plates cleaned up nicely, but the smooth sides now have slight discoloration on the areas over the heating elements.And now the worst part, by far. When the plates are removed, there is obviously no interlock on either one that disables the unit from heating. The unit heats up very nicely with the exposed heating elements glowing away, and that design failure is ripe for mischief. Though I do not subscribe to Consumers Reports, I would think this appliance would get a rating of ""Unacceptable"" for safety reasons. Unless you are a very conscientious adult, with no children, I would advise you to look for something else designed in this century with modern safety considerations built in. Seriously. I'm sending it back for that reason alone."
4.0,"03/03/13 - We've been using the new waffle maker for two months now and we've finally got the waffles to come out more evenly browned.  Perhaps it just took a while to find the correct setting and get it broke in.  I now would recommend this square waffle maker.  Although it still costs too much!We bought this waffle maker on December 27, 2012, online from Amazon.com.  I compared many waffle makers online and in store.  Although the online ad said this waffle maker could be bought at Lowes and somewhere else for only $56.99, I called and they didn't have it and could not even order it.  This one cost me $129.99 - that's twice as much!  I'm still using the one we got when we were married in 1971.  It's orange, (yes, I said orange!) large, square, and has the griddle as well.  I want to be able to turn out more than just enough waffles for two people to set down and eat at the same time.  I did not want Belgian style and I did not want a round or smaller waffle maker.  This Black & Decker model was one of probably only two I found that are square.  The description read Square Extra-Large Waffle Maker.  Well, yes, it is larger than any other waffle makers I found.  But, it's still not as large as the one we got in 1971.  And, it doesn't brown the waffles evenly, where as my old one does.  I now hook them both up and use them at the same time so we can get eight (8 squares) to start eating while the next batch is cooking.I tried using the recipe in the pamphlet that came with it but we reverted back to using our old standby made with Bisquick.  We like the flavor better and we love to add some sugar and vanilla to the batter for even better flavor.  Note:  Pour approximately 3/4 cup of batter in the center of the grill.  A full cup is too much and will overflow.  I use a full cup on in our old waffle maker.For those of you who have had difficulty with your waffles sticking to the grill, this is what works great for us:  BEFORE you plug in the grill and heat it, use a pastry brush and lightly brush both the top and bottom grills with liquid cooking oil.  Close the lid and heat.  Your waffles may cling to the top of the grill when you open it but will pop off really easy.  You DO NOT need to oil the grills again before pouring the next batch.  Do not overcook your waffles, unless you actually like them that way.  You can always close the lid and continue to cook them longer if they aren't done to your liking.ALSO, these grills DO NOT need to be scrubbed before you put them away.  It's like seasoning a good skillet.  Just clean it up with a couple paper towels to absorb any oil left on the grills then wipe it down with a warm damp dish cloth.  Try this, it really works!  If you scrub it, your waffles will stick the next time even if you oil the grills.I hope this review helps anyone else that is as picky as we are when it come to finding a waffle maker.  I know this review is a bit long, but I really wish I had found a review with all this information in it when we was searching for one.  It would have made our decision easier.We love our waffles!  LOL"
5.0,"This is the way a Sandwich grill should be designed.  Just like the ones I used as a boy 60 years ago.The back of the top lifts up so it sits flat on top of sandwichs when grilling (see photo).  I also like the design of the heating elements (see photo) which I consider an improvement over the thin wire that use to weave back & forth across the top & bottom.Follow the directions & coat the non-stick surface with cooking oil BEFORE each use.  USE COOKING OIL.  DONT use a non-stick spray.I measured an even 285ยบ temperature across both plates when the temperature control knob was set on MEDIUM.  This was too low a temperature to grill the bread.  I increased the temperature to where the knob was turned to ""Waffles"".  This readily grilled the bread.The plates are SECURELY held in place by the clip.WARNING:  There is space between the side handles & the exterior side of the housing.  The 2nd time I grilled 2 sandwiches, cheese melted out & down the side of the housing into the gap between the housing & the handle.  I had to remove the 2 handles to remove the melted cheese after the equipment cooled down.  To keep this from happening again & again, we all know how MURPHY works, I ran a bead of 100% Silicone Sealant into that gap.  Now melted cheese can't run into this hard to clean spot.  (See Photo)WAFFLES - I like the plates are designed to make good ole fashioned AMERICAN style Waffles, NOT the so-called BELGIUM style waffles.Registering my purchase online was easy."
3.0,"Waffles: I know exactly what reviewers mean when they complain about this waffle maker making soggy waffles. The first time I used this, I had the same experience. I used my standard pancake batter recipe, and they came out like squishy waffle imprinted pancakes with no crisp at all. I was very disappointed. Then, I searched for a better waffle recipe. I found a way to make this waffle maker work well. Google ""extra crispy waffle recipe"" & use the fifteenspatulas recipe. Without fail, I get much better results! They are nice and crisp, but not too crispy, after cooking on the high waffle setting for no 10-12 minutes (depending how browned you want them). The key is the addition of cornstarch. The recipe makes 4 batches on this iron, so I cook them all, cool, then freeze for later. You can cut the recipe in half to make just 2 batches (8 waffles). I cook the batches to be frozen for 10 minutes, since they will be toasted later, and they are great from the toaster! This waffle iron does tend to cook a little unevenly, so I cook for 6 minutes, flip them (from upper to lower end), and then cook for another 6 minutes. I also use a coconut oil spray between batches.Flat Iron: I've only made grilled cheese. It makes nice crisp grilled cheese. I tried using it as a sandwich iron, but that doesn't work well, because the sandwich is simply too thick with just cheese & bread. They get squished sort of lopsided. It probably would work better to lay the 2 sides flat and cook one side at a time. Also, the griddle really isn't a big enough surface for more than one sandwich (per side) made with premium bread. If you squeeze 2-4 sandwiches on each side, it will be unevenly cooked where the grooves are. This makes it useless for making multiple sandwiches...better off using a square griddle pan. I think the design flaw on the griddle side is that they should have made the entire surface flat.I will only be using this for making waffles. I do like that the plates can be removed for easy clean up. I would not put them in the dishwasher for fear of destroying its non-stick quality. I have had no issues with waffles sticking."
5.0,"I love this waffle maker!  It's like the ones our mom used, not those cheesy seeming plastic things they're making now.  It's also got a lot of excellent features that make my life easier.I'll mention right now that this is a VERY hot waffle maker.  They make the plastic ones to be ""cool touch"".  I'll trade the cool touch feature for the sturdier design of this versatile machine. I'm being careful and haven't burned myself yet. But it's something to consider if you'd like your children making waffles.  My ten year old could be careful enough, but I keep my five and eight year olds away.The waffles this machine makes are great!  They freeze well too.  The family is very happy. When the light goes of the unit is ready to make waffles. Pour in the batter and the light comes on again--wait for it to go off and the waffle is done (however, I usually go on instinct and sometimes pull out the waffle before the light goes off.)The open grill feature makes wonderful pancakes and fried eggs.  I have a big family and it's nice to have two pancakes cook at a shot without taking up all my stovetop!  I can have bacon and eggs on the stove and the pancakes on the waffle maker.  (I can also have a heart attack if I keep eating all these bacon and eggs!)The sandwich feature is nice.  I can cook two grilled cheese sandwiches at one time getting me out of the kitchen quicker.  Some advice--cheese might drip out the side of the sandwich.  Just keep the sandwich away from the back of the unit where the cables run in and the mess just wipes off--no problem.  The sandwiches cook far more uniformly than they do in a pan on the stove.  They taste great.This unit cleans up easily and changing the grills from waffle to flat is easy.  I recommend it over a lot of more costly models if you want more value for your money.  This is the most versatile waffle maker I've found and all the features actually work!"
2.0,"I bought this because I wanted to make classic non-Belgian buttermilk waffles. The removable (and therefore easily-washable) plates were a big selling point, and the griddle side was a greatly appreciated bonus. It was also very important to me that it made waffles in batches of four rather than two so that I could (hypothetically) get through a whole recipe of batter more quickly.The good:When I muster up the patience to use this machine, it makes very tasty waffles. Thin and crispy, just how I like them. And the griddle side makes good pancakes and grilled cheese.The nonstick coating has not given me any trouble. I seasoned it before first use, spray it with oil each time, and am careful not to scratch it with utensils or while washing.The bad:Firstly, the entire thing comes off as pretty flimsy. At first I let this go, as I figured some flexibility was required to allow the griddle side to cook things of various widths. But honestly, it still seems pretty shoddy.Secondly, the plates FALL OUT remarkably easily. When you leave it closed for a period of time, then open it, the chances of the top plate coming out is about 30% in my experience. (And I am very careful about putting them in correctly.) Unfortunately, since you have to leave it closed in order for it to preheat, that means the extremely hot preheated plate is quite likely to fall out. Once when this happened it fell on to my wrist. I put it under cool water immediately but the burn was still bad enough that it took weeks to heal.Thirdly, the waffles take a very long time to get crispy. About 10 minutes per sheet of four. When I make a regularly sized batch of waffle batter (3-4 cups), it takes 40 to 60 minutes to get through the batch. This is incredibly tedious, so I almost never make them. Which was the main point of getting this thing.Finally, it is very difficult to clean. The nonstick plates themselves are easy to remove and clean, but if any batter, cheese, or anything else spills out while cooking, it finds itself lodged in twenty different nooks and crannies. The area around the dial and the grooves in the handle are challenging, but the seams where the plastic parts attach to the metal are the worst offenders. You would think these would be sealed, but food easily seeps under the plastic and becomes almost impossible to remove. I've spent way too much time trying to dig gunk out with toothpicks and the like. I've given up now, it's just never going to be clean. So if you get this, be really careful not to let anything overflow.As soon as I find a better machine that makes THIN (think toaster-oven width) waffles, I'll be all over it."
4.0,"This is a wonderful waffle maker, my only complaint is that the plates donโt stay on as well as I wish they would, otherwise great purchase"
4.0,After reading many reviews I almost backed out. My main concern was not getting burned by loose hot plates. It ticked all the buttons of what my friend was looking for and she has years of being in the kitchen. She wanted to be able to make old fashion waffels for the grand kids. She said the first couple uses she fid have issue with bottom plate being loose but once she learned her way around that she is thoroughly pleased with the functioning of the unit over all.
4.0,Remember to keep the bottom piece with the longest spout on the bottom to avoid plaques falling or loosening when closing the unit. I had to tighten a bit the clip that holds the plaques to the unit.
2.0,"I purchased this in โLike Newโ condition but even if it was in brand new condition I cannot recommend this product. The plates are not non-stick like the listing claims. Cooking waffles is such a hassle (the lid is heavy and the handle to lift the lid is slippery and small, the clips holding the cooking plates will unclip in the middle of cooking which is a safety hazard) that I cannot recommend this product.Also like other reviews have stated, itโs VERY unstable. The โfeetโ on the unit (if you can even call little stubs feet) do not have rubber on them or anything. Trying to lift the heavy lid when cooking and itโs very hot is near impossible, the black handle on the top slips every time and will either push the unit backwards or it will start to open and then slip crashing back down.Also the lid never seemed stable. It just would lean back precariously like it was on the brink of crashing backwards if given the slightest push.I like the fact that the plates are removable, however, the โclipsโ that are meant to hold the plates in place DO NOT WORK. I had to physically pull the clips for the top and the bottom down because they wouldnโt hold the cooking plates in place. Terrible design choice, especially if youโre cooking and itโs around 400* and the clip decides to pop off. Complete safety hazard.Decided to return this unit and instead purchased a Cuisinart panini grill with removable plates. Have used it already and itโs a night and day difference. If buying a small sandwich grill, itโs important to get a unit with removable plates, otherwise itโs a pain to clean. The plates on the Cuisinart lock securely in place and are a breeze to take out. The non-stick feature works great instantly and when hand washing the plates, they clean in SECONDS. The quality is literally NIGHT and DAY. Donโt waste your money on the Black and Decker as you wonโt be happy with it and you could possibly get hurt. I would recommend getting the Cuisinart instead. Itโs a little bit more expensive but itโs worth it in the end.Hope this helps anyone looking for a reliable indoor grill."
4.0,"When I first got this waffle baker, I really was disappointed.  I washed the plates with soapy water and then oiled them up as described in the instructions - but my waffles were sticking worse than I've ever seen before.  Basically, the first (and sometimes the second) waffle of every batch was tearing in half and I had to scrape the pieces off of the top and bottom plates using a wooden spoon.  Nothing usable was left after this process and it was a huge, messy pain.  Because of the big mess, I would rewash the plates in soapy water after each use and then I tried to keep the waffles from sticking by using heavy coats of cooking spray; which left subsequent waffles soggy and oily, but still didn't prevent the first ones from tearing in half.After a few weeks of that, I got online to see what I could do to help resolve this problem - or if I should just throw this new waffle baker away.  (My old ones never had these problems, so I thought it was just a problem with the model.)Fortunately, I was able to come up with a few steps that completely eliminated my issues; so, here they are:1) Never wash those plates with soap (after the initial cleaning of course), since it takes the oil coating off - it's fine to soak them in water or to wipe them off; just don't use soapy water or you'll have to re-season them.2) Before pouring the first waffle, I heat the baker up to the maximum temperature and then turn it down to my desired waffle heat once the first waffle is poured.  This isn't important once the plates are fully seasoned, but it helps with the first few batches.3) Be sure to put enough oil in the waffle recipe.  In my case, the recipe calls for 2 tbsp but I've found that 1/4 tbsp extra makes a huge difference and probably just offsets the oil that didn't pour out of the measuring spoon anyway.4) In my case, I don't pull the waffle out the instant the light goes out.  I wait about 30 seconds until the steam starts to lighten up - this also prevents you from needing a hotpad when opening the baker.  (Something you'll learn fast with this particular model is that the steam coming out the front can be very hot:).)5) I don't use cooking spray at all anymore (which is more than I can say for my old waffle irons).  It isn't needed at all for the waffles to come out perfectly.With these easy tweaks, I'm now able to get perfect waffle off of this every time - from the first waffle to the last.  They taste great and the extras go into the freezer so the kids can warm them up in the toaster on weekends.I honestly will probably never use the grill plates since I have another electric griddle that is larger - but the waffle baker works really well.  I would highly recommend it."
4.0,"I'm really enjoying my waffle iron.  It makes delicious, crispy waffles.  We make a huge batch and freeze the leftovers.  When we reheat them in the toaster, they come out as crispy as when first made.I read all the reviews before purchasing and was concerned about the waffles sticking and the teflon coating coming off.  My first few batches of waffles were perfect.  Then I used the recipe for waffles on the Pioneer baking mix package, and the waffles stuck to both the top and bottom grid and I had a mess.  Here is what I learned.1. Closely follow the directions to season the waffle iron with oil before the first use.2. Always use a recipe that contains oil in the mix.  This seems to keep the batter from sticking.  (I've used the recipe on the Bisquick box with great success).3.  Don't spray the grids with nonstick cooking spray with each waffle because it discolors the waffles and it isn't needed as long as you follow rule #1&2.4. Preheat the waffle iron as directed in the instructions until the ready light goes out (5-8 minutes) before cooking your waffles.5. Don't rely on the light to go out to let you know when the waffle is done.  Instead, set a kitchen timer for 3-1/2 to 4 minutes and remove the waffle then.  Hearing the timer go off is better than having to sit there and stare at the light for 4 minutes anyway!6. If you forget these directions and end up with a sticky mess, do this:-unplug your waffle iron-stop up your sink and fill it with hot water, enough to submerge the waffle iron attachments- using two hot pads, remove each waffle attachment, one at a time, and place it in the hot water.  NOTE:  If you get your hot pad wet, get a new one.  Water will conduct heat through the hot pad to your hands.- let the attachments soak until the stuck on mess begins to loosen.- when cool enough to touch, pick up each piece and, using a utensil approved for nonstick surfaces, scrape off the stuck-on batter.  It will come off easily.-VERY IMPORTANT:  when you make your next batch of waffles, reseason the attachment as you did when you first got the iron.As for the teflon coating, mine hasn't had any problems.  Another reviewer said you aren't supposed to clean them while they are hot, so I always let mine cool completely before washing.  This is also one reason why I used hot water (to match the temperature of the hot attachments) instead of cold when removing the stuck-on gooey mess.I used the open grill to toast hamburger buns.  I didn't think it got very hot.  The first time I forgot to preheat it, but the second time I preheated it (closed) and it seemed like it lost heat quickly when open.  I think it works best when closed."
5.0,Flip the plates to the flat sides and make pancakes fry eggs and bacon as well. Totally versatile.
4.0,"When the machine heats up, the bottom plate pops. The latch is not the proper material to resist the heat produced. Other wise a great item."
4.0,"Even though I oil it as directed, it still sticks badly."
1.0,"Bought this because of the reversible plates, and the four section waffles.  Grew up with a very similar waffle maker that had wire heating element instead of the new fangled heating ring.  The waffle maker LOOKS beautiful, but it is lacking in quality.The temperature adjustment knob for example is REALLY sloppy loose.  And the chrome exterior does not fit snuggly up against the lip of the plates.  This allows oil or spray to actually run down from the plate and pool up INSIDE the base of the unit DIRECTLY beneath the red hot heating element.  If allowed to accumulate, there is no doubt in my mind that one of these days the whole thing will burst into flames as that puddle of cooking oil catches on fire INSIDE the base of the waffle maker.  NOT COOL.  I have tried to push the chrome portion so that it bends in a quarter of an inch so that the plates OVERLAP the edges of the top and bottom, but they do not bend easily, and I am afraid to push against them much harder since I may end up actually bending it too far.And when the unit arrived, the heating element on one side drooped away from the plate on the end that is supported in a bracket.  That made the element hot on one side and cooler on the other since the plate was not positioned the same distance from the plate throughout.  I was able to correct that by bending the bracket.  So at least that problem was solved easily.But we have now tried several waffle recipes, including the one that works on our round waffle iron, and we still have not found a recipe that will cook golden brown and semi-crunchy like a waffle is supposed to be.  The waffles come out splotchy, thin, and soft, and are not brown AT ALL.  They are more or less universally a pale yellow with brown patches.We gave our daughter one as a gift at the same time we bought ours.  She has the same problem.  However, she tried a waffle mix that is part of her long-term food storage supplies, and it worked perfectly.  Unfortunately we do not have any of that mix.And we had hoped to be able to use the square waffler maker side by side with the smaller round one, and even with our round Belgium waffle maker (yes we now have three waffle makers.  We like waffles,what can I tell you?) when we have family or overnight guests and want to make enough waffles quickly so we can all eat together.  That cannot happen now unless we make one type of batter for the two round waffle makers, and then make another batter that will brown and get crusty for the square one, since one batter will not work in all three of them with satisfactory results.I am consideringShort story is that we are not yet satisfied with the waffler maker and if we cannot find a waffle batter we like that works in all three, we are considering returning it for a refund.Until we resolve these issues, I cannot say that I would recommend this product to anyone.FOLLOW UP ON STATUS...returned item for full refund.  I can honestly say that there was NOTHING about his waffle maker that was quality.  The plates fit so loosely the move side to side almost a quarter of inch, leaving an 1/8"" gap on the side for batter and cooking oil to overflow UNDER THE PLATES down into the actual area where the heating element is.  The oil formed a puddle right under the heating element. It was just a matter of time before the oil puddle would be enough to actually catch on fire from the heat.  The plates are so loose, one of them actually fell off when I opened the waffler maker to put the batter on the plate.  The dial tha tcontrols the temperature is so sloppy loose it actually looks and feels like a homemade dial. The only professional quality feature of this waffle maker is the chrome on the outside.Our daughter's waffle maker that we gave to her as a gift when we bought the one for ourselves is EXACTLY like ours and has all the same issue. and she is returning it this week for a refund.IMHO, this is a COMPLETE PIECE OF JUNK.  And B&D should be embarrassed putting their name on it."
5.0,Very easy to use
5.0,"We're not big fans of Belgian waffles, but it's almost impossible to find a standard waffle iron anymore.  We bought this after reading the reviews, and we're very pleased. The waffles come out crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.  I like that it makes basically 4 waffles at a time. That way a couple people can start eating while you're making more.  The iron takes a while to heat up, but if you start heating and then make your batter, it works out well.  One important note (and not mentioned in the instructions), the indicator light comes back on when the waffle is done cooking, which is helpful. :-)"
5.0,I love my waffle maker!!! I like the square waffles so much better than the Belgium waffles.I make sourdough waffles and they are so good.
5.0,Muy buena calidad funciona perfecto
4.0,"I had a Black & Decker catalog number 20-64870 purchased in 1984, right after Black and Decker bought out the General Electric small appliance division.  The unit looked just like the earlier GE square waffle irons except for the name.  Just this year, 30 years later, the bottom element burned out and unable to find replacement parts, I began looking for a replacement machine.I was pleased to find that the square Black & Decker waffle maker is still around, relabeled as model G48TD which I purchased from Amazon.com.  The only differences are that the thermostat now has an ""off"" position, the knob is different and the current production is made in China, not the United States.Contrary to some reports, the sheet metal is the same gauge.  However the ""fit and finish"" is not  as good as the USA made product of 30 years ago.  The rear hinge is not at 90 degrees to the back and there is a slight gap between the grid and the case that was not present on the old unit. There is the possibility it could have been from freight damage, although the box that my unit arrived in did not have any bashed in corners or other signs of excessive roughness.The old unit was UL listed.  The new unit is ETL listed, a lesser known testing laboratory.  I ran a leakage current test on my sample and it measured 40 micro amperes, hot or cold, well under the 210 micro ampere limit set by most agencies.The unit bakes waffles in the same amount of time as the old machine, six minutes to be exact, however they do not come out quite as even, the rear of the waffle is a bit lighter.  I suspect that the gap between the grid and case at the back is the cause.  However, everyone in my household thinks that the waffles taste exactly the same. Unlike other users, I had no problems with waffles sticking.Only time will tell if this version lasts as long as my previous unit."
3.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



The product works ok.  In general it's very cheap and flimsy but it does work."
1.0,"This is a revision of my previous review in order to be more specific about the models involved.The current model of the Black and Decker 3-in-One Waffle Maker ( claiming, inappropriately, to be Model G48TD) is not up to the quality of the identical waffle-maker (the real model G48TD) I have enjoyed since 1995.  Complaints among Amazon customers about the unevenness of cooking of waffles and of the warping and poor non-stick properties are due to two changes in design and manufacture:  The griddles on the original are thicker and weigh 25 ounces each; those on the currrent model are  thinner and weigh18 ounces each.  The thinner griddles will be more prone to warping over time. Moreover, as you can see from the photo, the griddles  on the new unit do not fit as closely to the housing as on the old unit.  They are not ""flush"".  The new model has a gap between the griddle and the housing at  the rear end of the unit.  This would account for some un-evenness of cooking relative to the front of the unit.  I cannot report on the quality and durability of the non-stick finish at this point.  I tried to substitute my ""old"" griddles for the new ones, but they do not fit.  The design of the housing has changed.  This is a great disappointment, as the old units were functional, beautifully designed and manfactured.  There are none comparable to them on the market.The current model is not up to the quality of the identical waffle-maker I have enjoyed since 1995.  Complaints about the unevenness of cooking of waffles and of the warping and poor non-stick properties are due to two changes in design and manufacture:  The griddles on the original are thicker and weigh 25 ounces each; those on the currrent model are  thinner and weigh18 ounces each.  The thinner griddles will be more prone to warping over time. Moreover, as you can see from the photo, the griddles  on the new unit do not fit as closely to the housing as on the old unit.  They are not ""flush"".  The new model has a gap between the griddle and the housing at  the rear end of the unit.

3.0,We had the same product at my house for a few years and it was great. I decided to purchase one for my house and the quality was just not the best. I really wanted to love it but couldnโt
3.0,Only small problem is one of the tabs holding the upper plate in wasnโt tight so the plate would fall out. My son on law bent the tab inward so problem solved. It does demonstrate the poor quality control many of the reviews mention.
4.0,I like this waffle maker just fine.Things I don't like:The plate retention clips do the job but feel like they're going to wear out quickly. They feel so flimsy.The heating element is round in a square appliance so the corners don't get the correct heat.There's too much gap between the plates so the top doesn't get the same browning as the bottom.There's no dedicated overflow area to catch if you put too much batter.Not designed to be able to flip over and get better browning from the top plate.Those negatives don't make this waffle maker bad. They're just listed as items to know before you buy. I would buy this waffle maker again. You get a large 4 waffle maker for the lowest price I've ever seen with removable plates. Removable plates are the best feature on this kind of waffle maker and outweigh the negatives I listed.I've tried many waffle irons in the past and all the ones without removable plates are so difficult to clean I have used them a few times and then threw them away due to cleaning issues.
4.0,"My very old one finally gave in, this is same, feels a little lighter. Not the heavy duty cast iron grills, they are non stick and work well. Easy to flip over or take out to wash. Make nice size waffles for a growing family or to fill freezer for quick toaster waffle breakfast.  Flip over, make 8 pancakes at a time or 2 to 3 grilled cheese sandwiches, or .. Shipped a quickly,  well packaged."
2.0,"We bought this to make waffles after having to toss our trusty Sears version after thirty plus years. Unfortunately, the plates had cracked and couldn't be cleaned anymore.  The Black and Decker appeared to be a similar product.  It is actually what you see on Sears website now.  Buyer beware.  It is not the same product at all.Out of the box, it is clear that it is really cheaply made. The B&D is much smaller and lighter than the old Sears version. The plates are really thin. The old Sears had a heat diffusing plate over the heating elements. The B&D is missing that.  The body is thin metal that doesn't even align with the plates.  It didn't even sit evenly on the counter.  Not a good sign.In spite of the glaring deficiencies, we decided to see if maybe it still cooked ok. We cleaned and prepped the plates according to the directions.  There is a range setting for waffles on the temperature control, and I set it for high middle. The temperature control is incredibly flimsy.  Don't expect any accuracy. I lifted the top to put in the batter, and the whole thing is so light, it slid on the counter. I got that worked out, and finally started cooking waffles.  The directions say 3-5 minutes.  I checked at 3 minutes, and they were absolutely pale. Again at 5 minutes - the bottom was a little darker, but no brown on top.  Finally pulled them out around 8 minutes.  They were cooked through, but not brown.  One good thing, they came off the plates without sticking.Day 2, decided to give it one more try. I turned it up to the highest waffle setting.  3 minutes - not done. 5 minutes - not brown.  We tried putting some weight on top to see if that would help.  Finally pulled them out at 7 minutes. They had a very light brown, more on the bottom than the top, but were cooked through.  Again, they didn't stick.We won't be using this again. It sucks as a waffle maker. Unfortunately we missed the window to return to Amazon, but we are hoping B&D will do the right thing.  It simply doesn't do what they advertise.  We did not test the grill part.  It might work better, but I wouldn't count on it."
4.0,"This waffle maker is on the larger side when considering your kitchen appliances but it is a flat surface so you could still stack other items on it if you need space. But itโs also understandably bigger because you can make 4 at once which is convenient. That being said these are not your typical tall Belgian waffles, theyโre very flat and thin, almost like a pancake except pinched up with the grid pattern.The photo by the owner is pretty accurate for the one holding the waffle in it because majority of my waffles have come out slightly discolored as you go inward where it is less brown. I donโt mind the discoloration because it is usually cooked through and tastes fine. Some of them were left in for longer and got a lot darker so Iโd advise that if you are particular because these never burned in my experience. So far they have gotten a dark brown color and really crisp to the point where it breaks off like hardened waffles that were frozen but not burnt. Sometimes this machine would smoke up if it was too hot or batter was spilling or spattered around as we were using it. This also contributes to it getting dirty easily but Iโd say itโs fairly easy to just wipe down as you use it. But you could probably get away with just wiping down the exterior after you use it several times.Overall, it does what itโs suppose to do but nothing fancy or breakfast/brunch restaurant level so just know that. I say itโs worth it if youโre just a waffle lover and looking for a time saver by making more than one at once!"
5.0,"So I've had this for over a year and it's well loved and well used. I tend to use the waffle side more than the griddle plates because it's what I bought it for.Cooks evenly, no hot spots (which is surprising) obviously protect your hands and don't touch anything metal while this is on or has been recently on. It's the old fashioned kind, it's not encased in plastic, it's metal. Don't forget this or you're gonna burn yourself and blame the machine which is unfair to the machine.I've used the griddle open faced I've pressed sandwiched in it like a panini press but my favorite and predominant use is the waffle iron.I'm a kitchen gizmo person. I know I can do most things without them but why when there's a gizmo and gadget for it?  More specifically though I bought this because I wanted something other than Belgian waffles and I remembered that my grandmother had a waffle iron that looked dead on this though I cannot remember if her plates were removable.Any who, my grandmother passed away a few years back and I polled my sisters trying to see if anyone remembered the brand, no one was positive but my oldest sister told me she thought it was a black and decker so I took to the Amazon.Found this beauty and immediately bought it. Second it got delivered I had it out cleaned and ready to go ( those delivery notifications are awesome. Once I knew it was out for delivery I timed it with my normal carrier's route and had the batter ingredients out and ready to roll)I would caution you to be careful about the grease you use and to have something to collect it should it get too warm and slide off the plates.I use bacon grease coz that's how I was taught and it's wonderful but obviously thin and will leak out the corner if you use the correct amount to grease the iron.I've just put it on a part of the counter I can clean super easy between batches and be done with it.Both of my sisters covet this bad boy but they're on their own. I live a few thousand miles away now so they just have to get their own.  Last weekend they asked about it and it's what got me thinking its time to review this bad boy. Actually if I remember correctly I paid a bit more for it that what its pricing for now but honestly I'd do it all over again and for more.Good wafflemakers especially not Belgian waffle makers are hard to come by.Don't get me wrong I ALSO have a Belgian wafflemaker but this, this is what trotted out on my counter every couple of weekends."
3.0,"This is now $10 less than I paid but I still think at $50 the quality should be better.  I have owned an older model like this and it was sturdier.  The plates were very loose, I had to get out pliers and deepen the bend in the spring clips to secure them.  The plates are also lightweight.  As I said I have had one of these before and the plates were thicker with a better teflon coating.  It seems like they decided to make the plates cheaper and didn't bother to adjust the placement of the spring clips for the thinner plates.  The metal housing is also thinner than previous models and mine came with a couple of dents in lower rim.  When I unpacked it the plates were wrapped in tissue paper and on the griddle side of one the paper was stuck in the teflon coating.  Needless to say the coating is damaged in that area which is about a 1x2cm spot right on the edge of the cooking area.  There were also two small marks, about a 1/4cm each, where the coating did not adhere for whatever reason on this same griddle plate.  The waffle sides had no defects in the coating.  Nothing says they are dishwasher safe and the coating appears to be a low quality so probably handwash only.I have used it so far twice to make waffles and it worked fine.  The directions say the waffle is done when the light goes back off but I found myself cooking them 2-3 minutes longer than that because they were still soft.  A soft waffle might as well be a square pancake.  I also used the griddle side opened flat to make tuna melts and hamburgers.  It worked well for both.So, it is okay I'm keeping it because I really wanted a reversible waffle iron/griddle and this is the only one being made.  If you buy this though you will have to adjust the spring clips and bend out a couple of dents."
5.0,"This waffle maker design has been around for over 50 years.  The heating element is different from the original one I had (coiled wire vs. calrod) but the unit works great IF you follow the instructions.  You have to season the cooking plates with oil before using (not spray).  There after you can use spray oil, but I brush it to ensure an even coat.You have to be patient with cooking the waffles.  If you wait until the appliance completes the full cycle you will get perfectly browned waffles that don't stick to the cooking plates.  If you rush it, you will get a disaster that is difficult to clean and you'll probably want to throw the whole thing away.  When you cook waffles, be sure the heating element indicator light has turned off after pre-heating.  I set the temperature to the higher end of the waffle setting.  When you pour in the batter the light will go on again as the thermostat reacts to the batter's temperature.  Wait until the light goes off again before opening.  Don't peek at the cooking waffles or you'll split them in the middle and they'll stick.  Use a wood spatula to remove the waffles by gently lifting a corner.  The square shape, by the way, is handy for heating leftovers in a standard toaster.So far I have only used the recipe that came with the waffle maker, though I have doubled the amount of the eggs, using 1 with a half recipe and two with the full recipe.  I also use a generous table spoon when adding the amount of cooking oil called for in the recipe; a bit like some good bartenders do when pouring a shot.Clean the plates well with a nylon brush and soap and water after they've cooled.  I suspect that if you cook waffles with a lot of sugary ingredients, like chocolate chips and such, you may find cleaning the plates a little more challenging.  At some point I'm going to experiment with other waffle batter recipies using a sourdough starter or buttermilk, but for now I'll stick with the traditional recipe."
3.0,"I'm scared to keep cooking with it as it's non-stick quality seems to diminish with use.  I've used this waffle maker about 5 times and my last batch separated as I attempted to lift the lid--reminiscent of old-time waffle makers.  I never have got the timer dial set to where I was comfortable with it, so there's that, too. When I have used it at times, I have to be careful the waffle plates do not pop off as I open the lid.  The clips that hold the lids in place leave a lot to be desired.  I'm so unhappy with this waffle maker, I'm looking for a Belgium-style maker, instead."
5.0,I was so excited to see that B& D was still producing this model after my old one stopped working after 40 years.This one makes perfect waffles just like my old one. See you for the next review in about 40 years.Thanks Black & Decker
5.0,"Do not like Belgian waffles, too sweet.  Wanted an old fashioned style maker that also had larger capacity than what most round ones offer.  Only two in our family, but we can each have two squares to eat while a second batch is cooking.  Not digital either which for me is a big bonus."
2.0,"I had this exact appliance for about 15 years and it finally died. i really loved it so, naturally, when i found it was still being made i replaced it with the same thing. To my dismay the item arrived defective. The griddles do not fit the body properly, which is not only very dangerous, but leads to performance issues. The first and definite issue is that the griddles pop off when the lid is lifted from closed position, and in the open position, they pop off just from the heat increasing. You can see the gap in the photos attached and the little clip you can see is weak and not fitted properly so the whole griddle just pops off. The second issue is that i suspect the gaps between the body and griddles lets a lot of heat escape and results in the griddles not heating properly, in turn causing sticking - specifically with waffles (which stick so badly they need to be SCRAPED off and discarded). i figured it was a fluke so processed an exchange. The 2nd item came exactly the same way. i tried to use it thinking maybe i was just nuts. not so. there is a serious manufacturer's defect in at least one batch of these. I'm very sad as i sure did love the one i had that was properly made."
3.0,"The good: it works well, at least as a waffle maker!The bad: I selected 'open box, like new' rather than purchasing a new one. I've done this before and never had a problem. However, this arrived and was dirty. It's previous owners had clearly used it, not cleaned it, repackaged it and returned it.I feel that the price I paid was too high for a dirty, sticky, used appliance. But I had promised everyone waffles for breakfast so a scrubbed it up and used it anyway. I'm glad it works well, but do feel misled by amazon."
3.0,I wanted to replace a very old toasmaster basic waffle maker for 4 waffles that had removeable plates for easier cleaning.  This unit had that and also a variable temp control which I wanted.  The bad is the waffle plates almost fall out when you are using it.  I had to make some bends to the metal clips just to make them stay in.  There is only one small metal clip that hold each plate in so they don't really lock in very well. Very cheap build quality.
5.0,"Better than Roscoeโs Iโd say, and Iโm freezing them too. They donโt make them like this anymoreโฆ or I guess they do lol. Not like the average plastic ones, this one deserves 5 stars people"
3.0,"I have had 2 of these appliances. When they work they do a decent job. My first one failed under warranty and was replaced by B&D. This second one lasted until 6 months after the warranty expired. The unit wouldn't turn on. It went in the trash. I've read some of the reviews. The plates do not securely fit in the unit. There is movement. I have made waffles and pancakes weekly for several years and have been satisfied with the results. However, this appliance will not last as long as older ones did. China cannot make reliable appliances. Fortunately this is cheap enough to be able to replace it every few years, sadly. I am limited by space in my cabinet so this is the only type appliance that fits the bill. When we do business with China, you have to lower your standards!"
5.0,"Bought this waffle maker to replace one about 35 years old. Used couple times already, cooks good, just put little Pam on first one and nothing after. Takes 8-10 minutes to heat, and about 5 to cook to golden brown, we like them crispier so let them stay in about minute longer. I'm 75 so this will probably outlast me."
2.0,"I don't care for ""Belgian"" waffles and this is the only brand I can find offering ""real"" waffles. This is the 4th time I've purchased this item for use in various locales. The style has always been marginal, but useable. The price has gone way up in the past 3 years, but that is to be expected under the current fiscal policy. Unfortunately, quality control has also disappeared. The cooking plates spontaneously pop out in use, ruining the waffle. The non-stick coating has several flaws. The stainless steel was marred right out of the box. I returned it after one use and may have to learn to like the Belgian variety!"
1.0,"UPDATE, APR. 2019:  I held out for another year, trying other waffle irons (including the Foreman) and finally reordered this, as the best of a bad lot. It's still bad, and unsafe because the top grill falls of frequently, the floating hinge doesn't float enough to grill sandwiches (unless you but only a thin layer of cheese between two slices of bread), and it's slow to heat and to cook. After two years, I still dislike it, intensely.The only alternative for American (small hole) waffles is All-Clad's toy ($130 for a single-serving waffle iron) and I'm not THAT desperate! If you can find something other than this B & D that suits your needs, buy it!NOV. 2015 โ GE manufactured rectangular waffle/grills for I have no idea how many years. I grew up with one, wore out two of my own and then my parent's (a week ago) over the course of 65 years. The newer ones didn't cook quite as quickly as the older ones because of shielding over the heating coils but they still cooked evenly. And Black and Decker doesn't even have the talent to copy!It arrived yesterday and ruined its first (and last) batch of waffles today. Despite very thin plates it still takes about 10 minutes to heat. The top comes down too far and the top, somehow, despite its lightweight construction, is too heavy to allow waffles to rise. It cooks unevenly, varyingly:  sometimes one corner is overcooked while the diagonal one is raw. Sometimes only the center is cooked. Three waffles โ three different patterns of uneven cooking. The waffle recipe is the same one I have used for about 40 years and always produces light, well-risen waffles; the only adjustment I've ever had to make between the various GE waffle irons was the length of cooking. I honestly don't know what we're going to do for non-Belgian-style waffles. The GE's could grill sandwiches and bake waffles and I was hoping that this would replace them. More the fool me. The only alternative seems to be paying $130 for a George Foreman Evolve with waffle plates and that's far too much for a waffle iron.Immediately after breakfast, I told Amazon I wanted to return this poor appliance and was given the shipping label to return it at no cost to me. This is why I buy some many of our needs at Amazon. Living in a small town, two hours from any small city, I appreciate the selection I have on Amazon and their willingness to keep their customers happy."
4.0,"The Good:1. Makes old style thin waffles, not Belgian style.  This is a major plus.  We use a yeast-based recipe that does not work with the other style waffles.2. Makes very good waffles.  (I have not tried the grill function, but I think it should work fine.)3. Clips which hold the plate in place are thin, but I have had no problems with them.  The easy removal of the plates makes cleanup easy and this is a big plus when compared to other machines.  This also means that the plates can be kept for use as backups on another machine if the machine fails.  (see below)Problems:1. HOT.  As noted by other reviewers, this machine gets hot enough on the outside to potentially cause burns if you touch the metal shell rather than the plastic handle.  This has not been a problem in two years of regular use, but I would not let young kids use this machine.2. Reliability is a bit short of expectations.  Our current one is two years old and the thermostatic control has is now turning it on and off in very short cycles which increases cooking time a fair bit.  We use the unit a couple of times a month which means that it is failing after about 40 to 50 uses.Bottom line:Very good waffles, a bit hot to handle, reliability is so-so.  I am buying another because there are not many options for this style of machine, but I will also be looking at estate sales for older machines."
5.0,"This is the FOURTH waffle maker I have tried for my son.  I simply wanted to find a waffle maker that would make delicious, regular, slightly crispy (as opposed to fat, fluffy Belgian style) waffles. I don't know why this has become so challenging, but it truly has.  This waffle maker is sort of interesting.  You DO have to take care to put the plates in right, and one of mine was not pushed in all the way and melted the handle a bit, but I still 100% prefer making a waffle as good as they always were growing up versus the fat ones that are foisted on us today.  My son has to follow a gluten free diet, so he needed his own waffle maker.  This cooks the GF waffle batter nicely and since the plates are removeable, the surfaces can be cleaned better than those of waffle makers that do not have this feature."
4.0,"Had one of these when I was a kid, and when cleaning out the parents house found it sitting in a closet. It still worked so I looked up it's age, manufactured in 83! Was using it last week and the cord burned out, dead and likely a fire hazard. So I bought this one. The old one has three settings, low, hi, and waffle. The new one has an added setting, OFF! Only downside is that this newer model is out together in a much looser build. The old one was very sturdy, this new one is a little floppy. Only improvement I could suggest besides shoring it up a bit if improving the element. In the 80s the element was a semi circular element, and a newer one, may improve heating. A bit of insulation on the top and bottom would be nice too, it's bare metal above and below the element. I wonder if I could add some, maybe some fiberglass..."
3.0,"I purchased this grill for my dad's Christmas present and we just got some use out of it.  I'm a little disappointed in the quality of the grill, but the first batch of waffles came off the grill clean and delicious.Cons:-My 1st pet peeve with the grill: the metal casing is rather thin.  When we were fitting the removable plates in, they didn't feel too sturdy.  I'd hate to have a hot top plate fall off when taking a finished waffle off.-My 2nd one is that the temperature knob is very ""dinky"" not as solid as my dad's previous waffle grill.  This plays into my concern of the overall grill quality and how long it will last.  The optimistic me is hoping for 2 years of use.-Last but not least, the grill gets extremely hot; not just the plates, but all over.  The only touchable parts on the grill during use (or while the grill is still hot) are the black handles; there's 1 on the front and 2 on each side.  We've only had it for a day and already had 2 accidental burns.  The entire outside of the grill is burning hot during and after use.Pros:-The removable plates made clean-up so much easier than the previous grill.-The non-stick surface also worked out extremely well as I didn't have to scrub out ""leftover waffle"".-The light system is pretty accurate and should prevent burnt waffles.  The light clicks off when the grill is ready, you put 1 cup of batter on (the light will click on again), and when the light clicks off again the waffles are ready.Overall:This grill cooks waffles quick and easy, but the issues of safety and quality are in question.  I think this waffle grill is a little too expensive for what you're getting in quality."
5.0,Wife wanted a waffle maker with removable plates - did a bunch of research and found & the B&D to be the best value for the money - haven't had a chance to make waffles - yet - but - seems to be a nice little unit over all ....
5.0,We just ordered this one to replace one we received 40 years ago as a wedding gift. Exactly the same except digital temp. If this one is half as good it will outlast me!
2.0,The clips that hold the plates in place are easily bent and nearly impossible the get them so they will hold the plates in place. When I opened it the top clip was already bent.
3.0,My old. Griddle quit.  Bought this because it has flat and waffle plates.  Waffle plates are extremely thin.  Almost roll up like waffle cone. But it gets hot and I normally use the flat sides.
4.0,"The ability to switch around the plates between waffle and griddle is great, and the top hinges all the way back to give you two cooking surfaces to use, but the clips that hold the plates in place a pretty flimsy, they consist of two tabs in the hinge side and a single piece of bent metal on the other.Additionally, there is no amount of insulation or heat mitigation in the design, the outer shell is just as exposed to the heating elements as the inner cooking plates. Be very careful to only touch it by the handles when in use, touching it literally anywhere else is likely to burn you. Something as simple as one extra layer of metal between the heating elements and the outer shell would have reduced this possibility.Still, the best pancakes I've ever made came out of this, and my kids are quite satisfied, so I'm still glad to have it. Its design is so simple that I suspect it will last as long as the cooking plates do."
4.0,"My husband and I received a similar, reverse plate, waffle iron for our wedding, 42 years ago. Last year it died and so did our waffle making! One of my grandsons loved our macadamia nut waffles and I'm sure everyone knows what a grandmother will do to try to spoil her grandkids! We looked online for over a year until, voila, I found one through Amazon (I LOVE AMAZON). I read the reviews and realized that most of the buyers who gave this wonderful dual purpose appliance 2 or 3 stars, were younger and I guess they assume things are made with the great quality that their parents things were made with. We received ours within 2 days, as we are Prime members, and indeed, the metal seems lighter weight, the hinges that hold the plates down, do seem a little more flimsy than our 42 year old one did. Having lived long enough to be aware that ""planned obsolescence"" is a common problem, we decided we would just be a little more gentle with our waffle iron. We spray the waffle grills with spray oil before cooking waffles, just like we did with our old one as it increased in age, and are very careful not to force the plates into the hinges. So far, it's been a wonderful purchase! The waffles cook however one likes them, crispy or a little doughy. We now have a really happy grandson again! Thank you again Amazon!"
4.0,"HiHad a little trouble at first, I had the grills for the waffle maker placed in the wrong slots so they weren't  releasing probably. I later found out that it was the recipe that I use to make this non-dairy Healthy waffles that make it stick.  Rising of a normal waffle mix helps for easy release. Even with that recipe for healthy waffles being a little stressful, this works like a complete dream. I loved it so much I made a month supply of waffles haha. This waffle maker is a major improvement from what I first started with. This waffle maker makes it enjoyable to make waffles now. When you get it in your home you're going to notice that it is really thin, and it's going to feel cheaply made because of that, but it is not. tt will tell you do not touch the top of the waffle maker when in use and you do not do that. the coil is right there. They could have supplied it with a thicker housing to compensate for the heat it gives off.  The grills are really easy to clean. you're going to want to pay attention to the placement of the grills because I have noticed that it matters, if not they are going to fall out of the slots."
5.0,"I have wanted a decent waffle maker for quite a while. A cheap model my wife picked up a few years ago was pure junk and didn't even have an adjustable temperature setting. Since it seems to be impossible to find anything except Belgian style models in any stores, I started doing some research online.The Black and Decker G48TD looks like the old 1950's model my parents had except it has aluminum grids instead of cast iron like the older one. Although the B&D model had a pretty high overall rating in reviews, it did have a number of complaints about sticking waffles and poorly holding grid clips so I was a little concerned at first. However, since all the other waffle maker reviews I found were overall lower in user satisfaction, I decided to buy the G48TD - and I'm really glad I did!I think the aluminum grid plates are great and the clips hold mine in place very securely.  The browning is surprisingly even although the bottom does, as others have reported, get a little more heat than the top. I found that very minor in mine and it certainly didn't detract from the quality or taste of the resulting waffles. I also followed the grid conditioning instructions precisely and haven't had a sticking waffle yet. It does take a little force sometimes to lift the lid but there hasn't been any tearing or sticking of the waffles themselves. I do use a quick spray of a no-stick oil product before initial heating each cooking session.Since my real interest is only in waffles, I haven't tried the grilling capabilities of the G48TD.Pro's:  Great tasting waffles and consistent cooking. Adjustable temperature control with a  useful  range. No sticking if prepped as in the instructions.Con's:  Housing does get very hot in use and can burn fingers.  Temperature knob moves a little too easily and can be  inadvertently set to another temperature if nudged by accident when moving the waffle maker."
4.0,"I believe this is the same model that Sunbeam or some other appliance company introduced at least 40 years ago.  That company was purchased years ago by Blach &  Decker, I still have one in that branding that is at least 30 years old and one a new second waffle maker.  They both look alike, function alike, and take the same amount of time to bake a 4-section waffle.  They are both of pretty good build quality and produce great waffles.  Each 1/4 section has 6 square holes across and 6 down for a total of 36--more than most other waffle makers, allowing for a less doughy waffle.  I really do not care for Belgium Waffles or their makers.  To produce a great golden brown waffle you need a good recipie, mix as directed (don't over beat), the recipie should call for a very small amount of oil (keeps waffles from sticking) or spray small amount like PAM before loading batter for each waffle, then watch the appliance carefully and pay attention to the bake time.  When steam starts rising from between the plates it should be done.  Practice before making waffles for guests.  I personally like a recipie that calls for buttermilk.  Avoid readymade packaged batter mix.  And, I rarely use the additional flat plates for anything."
2.0,browns up nicely on bottom side but to light topside. have to manually flip over to get it close to proper texture finish!

5.0,"Nothing!!This is my 3rd one. I got my 1st one when I was in my late teens from my mom as a Christmas gift.I bought my 2nd one when I was in my middle to late 30's.I am 71 years old and just got this 3rd one for my birthday.This is a GREAT product, I would recommend it to anyone.Dolores"
4.0,"I really like this waffle maker. We have three in the office. We bought a forth because there was no overfill catch on one. Two were single/mini waffles. I looked through all the amazon reviews on popular / highly rated waffle makers via 3rd party sites. I was struck with hesitation after seeing most amazon reviews for these items the last couple of months are all one star.We just bought a second one of these. It makes great waffles. The removable inserts are secure. We didn't have any problems with the latch because we carefully put them on and take them off. We pull the metal latch back a bit and then release it. We had no problem with heat. We rubbed oil on initially with a paper towel.  One more thing that was great is the waffle maker is hot, but it has several handles that are not. Out of our previous three, only one had a handle that didn't get extremely hot after 3 or more batches.I hope this is helpful for anyone like me, that was confused by all the one star reviews. I gave it four out of five, for price, easy of use, great waffles, but it is on the slow side. We make 10-20 batches so we just bought a second one to speed things up."
4.0,"This doesn't seem as sturdy as the one I remember from many years ago.  It needs to be treated gently.  The clips are fragile and need to be treated with care.  Don't snap the plates onto the lids.  I think the clips would break.  The hinges seem to be a little loose but that may be because the top lid can be raised up to close over thick items (like a sandwich).It makes great waffles. They pop out with no trouble.  I've used the flat sides several times to make sandwiches and even fried eggs.  I can scramble an egg on one plate and over easy one the other one.  I am very happy with it.  Sandwiches grill up beautifully but  closing the heavy lids together tends to flatten them.  Might do better to grill with lids open.I'm planning to take this in my motorhome this summer.  I'll be able to cook outdoors and with minimal cleanup.  I don't know about storing it on it's side. There is nothing to hold the lids together and there are handles, hinges, etc on all of the sides.  We'll see.There have been some complaints that the outside gets very hot.  Come on, now.  It's metal.  We are so used to appliances being made out of plastic."
3.0,The plates were already chipped. Was very disappointed
4.0,"Pros: excellent waffles from day one, design is attractive, for some the grilling function might be a a nice feature, and the warning light and heat control work well, very excellent price for what you get.Cons: a little slow to heat up - so for me the grlling function takes too long to heat up - and I'd rather just use a frying pan for my grilled cheese sandwiches, the non-stick coating seems a bit thin with some little bare metal spots showing through at some contact points at the hinge assemblies - although this is not affecting the actual cooking surface, and the heat control seems a little loose - although it seems to work fine, and the clip design holding the plates could be a little better / stronger.Conclusion: this waffle iron does very well what it's designed to do with perfect waffles every time so far straight out of the box, for the price and convenience of buying it with free shipping at Amazon it's a hard deal to beat.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend and in fact offered to have one sent to my sister and parents."
3.0,"One of the few waffle irons on the marked that's like the 1960s-1980s waffle iron your grandmother had that laster thirty to forty years.  Removable plates to swap to griddle mode but, more importantly, for the kind of easy and thorough cleaning that you can never accomplish with the heating plates built in.So close, but unfortunately the clasp that holds the plates in place is very flimsy and cheap, meaning it releases at the slightest resistance.  This means you open your waffle iron and instead of seeing the top of your waffle you see your top heating plate that has fallen free and now has to be dealt with while still at cooking temperature.So close, Black and Decker.  So close.  They don't make them like they used to, and even when they try, they just can't resist the urge to ruin it by cheaping out."
2.0,Removable gridle/waffle plate looser than should be.
3.0,"I, like Alan-- whose review is awesome-- long for the old days of the Toastmaster version, which I used on and off for almost 50 years. I bought this latest iteration a few years ago. My new wife found the greasiness, etc., of the old one too disgusting. She does not come from a waffle-making family. Obviously.Anyway: they've cost-reduced this design so much it's pathetic. The base is not as heavy as it used to be, giving me the sense that when I raise the lid all the way back, it may tip over. Alan's right that the plates are thinner and warp. The clips that hold the plates don't work as well as they used to.I wish Black and Decker would come out with a ""Toastmaster Classic Waffle Iron"" model that's the way they used to be made and charge $90 or $100 for it.  If they want to keep a lower price point with this overly-cost-reduced model, fine. But give us the Best Waffle Iron in the World Back!! It would be nice if it were made in North America, too, if you please."
2.0,Doesnโt hear up very well at all
5.0,The best for grilled cheese
3.0,"The good .. it does the job.The bad...  Poor quality.  The clips that holds plates in are so flimsy that the plates kept falling out. Had to bend them to work. I can see them breaking. Im going to order extra now. Also do not push top down or you will bend clips again.  The metal body is super thin & will bend and mis shape. Easily.  Heat up time is forever. Plug it in long before you are ready to use it. Reheat for the next batch seems long too. No what I expected. If you trying to make multiple batches, even covered they get cold.  The Teflon coating after only a few uses has worn off where clips are & on the sides from the sharp edge of the body of the unit.  I would send the p.o.s. back but already through the box away."
5.0,"After reading many of the previous reviews for this item, I decided to ensure that I seasoned both sides of the grill adequately prior to first use. I opened out the appliance to the flat position, waffle iron side up. Using a pastry brush, I first brushed both waffle sides with vegetable oil. I turned on the iron about 2/3 (tried it first with a lower temperature but it turned itself off too soon), and let it heat for about 20 minutes. After it cooled, I wiped off all the excess oil. I then repeated the same steps with the griddle side.I was rewarded with perfect, crispy waffles that easily came off the iron. It takes me back to my childhood when my family often spent Sunday mornings around the table, waffle iron on one end, while my mom made her fabulous light fluffy waffles, or maybe we made pancakes instead, the kind where you drizzle batter in smiley faces or Mickey Mouse shapes, let them cook a bit, then poured more batter ending up with decorated pancakes. Remember?I thought I'd share my family waffle recipe, the secret to which is beating the egg whites separately then folding them in: Mix 2 c. flour, 4 t. baking powder, 1/2 t. salt in a large bowl. Separate 3 eggs, beat yolks together with 2 c. milk. Beat whites in a bowl until stiff. Mix milk/egg mixture into dry ingredients until smooth. Mix in 2 T. melted butter, then fold in egg whites. Pour one cup onto hot griddle and cook as per instructions provided. Tip: Wait until steam stops escaping from the edges of the griddle before opening.I'm delighted with the appliance, and hope you'll try this waffle recipe!"
1.0,"I hate giving negative reviews and I gave this unit a many chances as I deemed safe but sent it back after the first use.  I purchased this unit because I thought I was getting a great value.  Make paninis, waffles and everything else for $40?  Wow!  Great value right?  Not so much.  When I took it out of the box the fit and finish was cheaper than what I would have thought for the money but I've never owned a waffle maker so I gave it chance.  I also really wanted to make my 2 year old some waffles.  She just started pre-school and was always requesting waffles.  They make them fresh there.  We had been giving her the frozen waffles and she wouldn't eat them.  I get it, I prefer fresh food as well.  So I wash the plates as instructed and turn it on for the first time.  The exterior gets really really hot!  I pour in the batter when the light goes off as instructed and water for the waffles to cook.  When the indicator goes off I raise the lid and remove the waffles.  So far so good.  I pour the batter for the second batch.  Because it is non-stick I don't oil the plates.  Huge mistake!  The waffles stick to the plates and the plate disconnects from the top of the unit.  In trying to dislodge the plate I burn myself on the top of the unit.  I write off this batch of waffles and turn off the unit and wait on it to cool.  When I am able to finally remove the burned waffles from the unit I was the unit and box it up for return.  If this unit had stronger clips to keep the plastes in place it would be better.  If the manufacturer could find a way to keep the exerior of the unit from getting so hot that would also make a much better product.  Last impressions.  Cheaply made unit that will burn you if you are not careful.  Non-stick is ineffective after the first batch of waffles.  Would not purchase."
2.0,"The media could not be loaded.
                



Es un producto no recomendado . No tiene mucha estabilidad y es un poco peligroso a la hora de manipularlo por que se calienta completo. Serรญa bueno valorar otras ofertas ."
2.0,"As others have noted, the fit is very poor.  In my unit the clip that holds the lower plate in place will not stay closed.  There is a significant gap around the edges of the lower plate, you can see the heating element.  As a result it takes a long time to heat and a long time to cook.You'll need hot pads to hold the lower plate down while opening the waffle iron.Thankfully the upper plate stays clipped into place, although it also moves quite a bit.The instructions advise 3-5 minutes to bake a waffle, I found 8-9 minutes were required.  Not so good if you are tying to make a bunch of waffles for a group.The plates are very light and don't retain much heat, so the heating element is on most of the time.  The center of the waffle gets quite dark by the time the edges are cooked, even if the waffle doesn't completely fill the plate."
1.0,"I purchased this because I wanted a waffle iron that does what this claims to do, have plates that cook waffles or can be flipped over to use as a griddle or to smash sandwiches. The one I used as a child must have had cast iron plates, because we used it a lot and never had problems.The label is peeling after 3 uses. The plates scratched through the coating the very first time I put them in the waffle maker where the tabs hold them in; after 3 uses the coating is gone wherever it has made contact with any other surface, but the cooking surfaces are still intact, because I have been careful. The waffle recipe it comes with is SO wrong as to be mind-boggling, it is far too thick to pour. The heating surfaces do not cook even remotely evenly, with one edge of the waffle still pale while the other side is toasty brown, though it is even as far as top and bottom. My first two uses were smashed sandwiches, and it worked fine for that, other than the edges of the plates wearing off where they make contact with the device. Also the plates and the unit are so lightweight that they don't really smash the sandwich. I think if it had cast iron plates instead of cheap aluminum with a thin veneer of nonstick coating it would work okay. I would honestly quit if I worked for them, and be ashamed for putting out such a terrible product.On a side note, I recycled the box already so I can't send it back, and if I did they would replace it with another piece of soon-to-be-garbage. I expect to get maybe...MAYBE about 10 uses out of it before it goes in the trash for falling apart, and that is absolutely shameful.The packaging and shipment was fine, no complaints, and this is the first negative review on ANYTHING I have ever purchased.Black and Decker should hire a college group to go over their products and do an actual cost/benefit analysis with a view toward sustainability and product satisfaction before unleashing such junk."
5.0,"Cooks well and cleanly.  However, be mindful that you need to allow just a little bit of time between taking out the fresh cooked waffle and putting in new batter to cook.  If you start the process too quickly, you can get an undone center and the outsides will be done as intended.  Also I found that when it cools down I can wrap the cord around the bottom half and put the cord in that small groove and lock it in with the plug in on the other side.  I use a large pan under it to catch any overage-spill from baking.  I have put too much batter in and had it ooze out the sides and drip onto that pan.  It breaks right off from the waffle iron when done, and I can easily clean up the drip on the pan underneath.  Use aluminum foil and merely dispose of the foil when done.  I used NO spray, but relied on the oil I have in my waffle recipe (home style recipe).  I wish there were a cross-element of coiled heating wire to get the centers of the grill more even, rather than the solid heating element.  However, this type of element will be a lot harder to damage or burn out later on."
2.0,"I made waffles but the plates would not stay in place, the top plate continues to pop out of place.  It is definitely not made as well as the ones that were made years ago.  Poor quality."
4.0,"My fiance and I love this, and use it all the time. Three months later, it's still going strong. It's easy to remove and clean the plates. We use it as a panini press, waffle iron, and open griddle. It comes with very simple instructions, though I wouldn't say we really needed any. There are a couple health and safety warnings that you should read through, but honestly, it's such a small booklet that you could read it in the time it takes to heat up.The only reason I docked it one star is because it heats up a bit slower than the other version I owned (by Cuisinart and like... three times as expensive). Also, if you're not careful with the waffle batter, it can leak a little into the area where the plates lock in, and that can be a bit of a pain to clean. Don't want that touching the heating element!Overall, for the price, it's dependable, good quality, and works well. I'd highly recommend it if you're thinking about a waffle maker or panini press, or replace two gadgets in your house with it!"
5.0,"I was replacing a 30+ year old Toastmaster waffle maker that looks like a twin of this one, except Black & Decker has solid heating element in place of spiral wire.  The new waffle maker works perfectly, easy to clean because plates can be removed.  I've used a little oil, brushed on, and have no residue so far.I'm very happy with this replacement, and look forward to years of use."
4.0,"I've only used this product 3 times since purchasing it, but so far, it's a jewel in my kitchen!  The metal clips that hold the grill/waffle plates on lack quality, so I'm treating them with TLC to make sure they don't break off.The waffles have turned out very well every time I've made them. The ""easy waffle"" recipe in the instruction manual is WONDERFUL and can be adapted into more complex creations quite easily.The preheat time is rather long, so I suggest warming up the griddle while you are preparing the batter. If you don't wait long enough for preheat, you'll be stuck waiting for it during the cooking time, which can cause the waffles to dry out a bit.Treat the nonstick material with kid gloves! I followed the instructions and brushed the griddle plates with melted butter prior to use, but a little stickage is always inevitable. I tried sliding a heat resistant spatula under the waffle to loosen it. When that didn't work, I very gently slid a small fork under it. That released the waffle, but I was stunned to see that even that one small item caused a scratch to the non-stick material!Overall, I would recommend this product.  If you treat it well, it will deliver great results!

5.0,"My wife and I spent a great deal of time researching and comparing waffle irons, evaluating each on price, performance, ease of use, and durability.  Part of our research involved reading other customers' reviews, which were nearly all favorable, but our evaluation, except for durability, is based upon our experiences.First, it's great to have a waffle iron that actually gets waffles done--i.e., crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, with a golden-brown appearance.  The ""Done"" indicator light actually works and is, incredibly, accurate, too.Second, this waffle iron produces large, square waffles with partitions to enable the user to easily divide the waffles into four.  These fit very nicely in a toaster, so it's easy to freeze them and warm them anytime you need a ""waffle fix.""Third, the plates are removable for washing, and they slip easily in and out of the frame, to which they are secured by small metal clips.  The only negative comment we saw on this product was that the clips did not seem to work very well and needed to be bent to function.  This has not been our experience: the clips on our waffle iron work exactly as they were intended.Fourth, comparisons with other waffle irons left them in the dust: this product was clearly superior to others costing between two and five times as much.Since we have not had our waffle iron for a long time, we cannot judge its durability, but other customers have indicated that it is good for the long haul, and, as far as we can tell, we will eventually agree.In sum, this is a great product!  It does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it well, and much more cheaply than many others.  We highly recommend it."
5.0,"We have owned this B&D model for about 8 years and get great waffles every time. We're buying two more for our sons. Some revIews complain of recent quality problems, I guess we'll see. Here are two waffle cooking tips I use, learned from a 1939 GE model with no temp knob or anything. I plugged it in for 4 minutes and started cooking. 1.) Heat your waffle iron to the hottest waffle setting. When it's preheated pour in your batter and start a timer for 4 minutes, don't use the light on the machine. You can wait for the steaming to stop but that's ""iffy."" The first waffle will be a bit more done than the rest, which will be light golden. If you like them crisper, add 30 seconds or a minute to your timer. Time every waffle and ignore the light. Also-and most importantly-Never Wash Your Grill Plates!! Follow instructions for treating prior to first use. Then make waffles , clean exterior and put away until next time. You never have to clean the waffle side of the plates. Have butter in your recipe? Me too, doesn't matter. Washing the thing means it never stops sticking. The 1939 model wasn't washed for decades. (""OMG, you never washed it??"") They told you not to wash it! If you use the flat grill side and need to clean that one side, you may use a little soap and a sponge and/or paper towels. Use a wet one to rinse it. Take it from a good cook, we've become overly fanatic about washing things, and the waffle side will work for you unwashed. The coating and metal clips will last better too. Happy cooking!"
4.0,Sรบper rรกpida  me encanta
1.0,"I had high but skeptical hopes about this product after reading the mixed reviews. I would like to point out that I suggested this for a client of mine. Iโm a care giver for an elderly woman and she bought this waffle iron on my recommendation.After reading all of the instructions..I washed it as recommended and then put in the grill plates. I was immediately concerned when I noticed how loose they were. Especially the top plate. My concerns werenโt unfounded as I plugged in the unit and it began to heat up. About half way through the heating process I heard a โpop!!โ And much to my dismay..I noticed that the bottom grill plate had popped out of place. I could clearly see the glowing red heating element beneath it. I quickly unplugged the unit and tried to replace the grill plate. I of course heeded the warning about the casing getting extremely hot!! I used a hot pad but still managed to singe my finger through the hot pad!! I let the unit completely cool off while I tried to cool my burned finger off. Deciding to give it one last chance, thinking it was just a fluke on a first heating and the problem would go away. I proceeded to make my first batch of waffles. All was going well until I started the second batch and this time the TOP grill plate fell off right into the wet batter on the bottom grill plate! Mind you it was screaming hot as was the unit itself. So now I had to figure out how to get the grill back on the top of the unit using two hot pads without burning my hands again or getting waffle batter all over the hot pad. What a mess!! Iโm done!! B&D you need to go back to the drawing board or if this is just a lemon..Work on better quality control at the factory!! Iโve half a mind to sue over this!! For anyone reading this review..heed my warning! Move on!! Do NOT buy this very dangerous waffle iron!!"
4.0,"This is one of the only waffle/griddle units available that makes the old-fashioned, standard waffle, not the thick, Belgian style waffles. This is the third Black+Decker Waffle Maker that I have owned over the last 35 years. The other two died when one of the heating elements failed.The waffle maker works well. For the first two I used a canola cooking spray to avoid sticking waffles but I found that I would get a buildup of black  residue that would come off on the waffles. Now I use a brush to add a safflower oil to the grid for the first waffle and do not use any oil for the remaining waffles. The waffle may stick somewhat, but will still release from the plates. YMMV according to the amount of oil/melted butter in your recipe.I have used the flat side of the plates for grilled sandwhiches and that also works well. I do not  use the unit as a griddle as I have a dedicated, large electric griddle for pancakes and french toast."
5.0,Makes waffles that fit in toaster. I can make batches and freeze them for cheaper than from the store
5.0,"I have searched for a long time for a good waffle maker: one that makes waffles that are traditional, not belgian.  Belgian waffles have too deep of squares for me and are too thick to go in a normal toaster.  This waffle maker finally makes normal sized waffles, the size of a piece of bread, with small holes.It cooks perfectly every time...the waffles are evenly cooked and slide very easily off when you want to remove them.  They look great and they taste excellent.  It makes four waffles at a time, which was another requirement (I hate little wafflemakers...you can't feed a family on those).  If you have leftovers you can toss them in the fridge and then later in a normal toaster, which makes them crisp and delicious again.  I almost like them better the second time.The construction is durable and attractive, not made of that plastic junk that you normally see in a wafflemaker.  I can find no downside to it's construction, all smoothly operating and simple.  It doesn't get dirty, but if it did it would be really simple to pull out the waffle surface and wash it off however you want.I have no use for the flat side of this waffle iron, so I don't use it.I have owned a number of waffle irons and I've never been happy with any of them until I got this one.  I bought one for my mother, and will recommend it to anyone who is looking for traditional--not belgian--waffles and wants a precision machine to do it."
2.0,"After owning this waffle maker for over 1 year I've finally had enough and am throwing it out. It's big, it's bulky, it's heavy and takes forever to heat up. If using as waffle maker, it takes 7-8 minutes to heat up, if using as griddle, try infinity. That part you can plan ahead for as long as you know it. I suppose you can make your batter while this piece of junk pre-heats.I've burned myself and had to scrape bits of waffles off this thing more often than I can count. And yes, I did read and follow all of the instructions. I am German after all. The metal outside coating has no insulation whatsoever, so it gets crazy hot, really bad idea if you have kids. I've even burned my fingers on the black parts where you lift the top, on the medium waffle setting.Different waffle recipes are hit or miss. I always make sure I use adequate oil in my batter, but I've found that some recipes stick. You end up with almost burnt outside waffles that are stuck to the plates, while the inside isn't cooked. On the medium setting, mind you, using recipes from magazines that have clearly been tested.Having removable plates comes in handy when you have that kind off mess on your hands. Ever scraped bits of half burnt half cooked waffles off one of these with a wooden chopstick? Not fun. Unfortunately, the removable plates have a tendency to come off the top part even when they're clipped in properly, just because they are freakin' heavy and the clip is weak. Then you end up trying to lift that heavy ass plate off your waffle trying not to burn yourself.This thing is just poorly thought out and not safe to use. I will buy a German brand next time."
3.0,This doesn't heat as quick as a standard griddle. It takes much longer to make on this. I like the fact that it folds and the plates can be cleaned in the dishwasher. I did not like the way the package was shipped. While I understood that it would not cone in the original packaging  there was no packaging materials placed in the box to prevent it from being damaged during the shipping process. My husband had to fix one of the prongs when it arrived because it was bent and would not hold the plates in place.
5.0,"This is one of the best waffle makers I have found. It has removable trays for easy cleaning. The shell has barely anything in it for easy cleaning. The light on the front lets you know when it is heating up and when it is at temperature. The knob has a fluid motion instead of preset settings. It does have settings listed on it. One set of setting for when it is used as a griddle, and one set for when it is used as a waffle iron. When used as a griddle, it can be used open for eggs, bacon, pancakes, and other items. It can also be used as a closed griddle for sandwiches, hamburgers, and others.I have used it to cook waffles, sandwiches, and hamburgers. All have been cooked evenly and fully. The hamburgers were done in about 6-7 minutes and sandwiches in about 3-4 minutes. This cuts down on time since each side would have to be cooked in a skillet or open griddle. With this, both sides are cooked at the same heat, for the same amount of time. When using it with greasy items, such as hamburgers, it has a drip trough for the grease to run to and run out of the drip spout. Not cooking it in its own grease helps to lower the grease content."
5.0,I love this product. Itโs great for toasted sandwichโs & waffles.
1.0,"I ordered this waffle maker to replace one I had for 30 years that looked exactly the same but recently died. As others have noted, when heated to Waffle setting, the lower plate pops up (disengages) from the clip, making it unsafe and impossible to use.  I also found that the plates on this appliance weigh less than those on my old one and the item has a slightly cheaper feel.  I even tried heating it with my old heavier plates attached but the lower one still pops off when hot. Some reviewers reported a positive experience so unsure if the one I received happens to be defective or if this is a new design flaw, but I will definitely be returning it as it is totally useless."
1.0,"I ordered and returned 2 of these. Top cooking plate of the first one had a lot of places where the black paint was scratched off or never was painted. Returned it and ordered another one. Top cooking plate of the second one would not stay clasped in and didn't fit well in the top cover. I didn't even use the waffle maker. I had this brand and model waffle maker that worked well for 15 years but quality and workmanship of these new ones were terrible. Unacceptable. In addition returning the second one was problematic. I returned the first one to our local Kohl's store (2 miles away). No box or label required. I wasn't offered that option for returning the second one. Had to return to UPS Store 20 miles away. Our local Staples is a UPS pickup location but required that I put the item in a box which I did not have. I had to tear up the shipping box it came in because it was impossible to open. There was a ""pull here"" arrow to open but it did not work. Used scissors, box cutter and finally a screw driver to open. Box was unusable. Not happy with the item or the return procedure."
5.0,"Has removable plates for cleaning. Be sure not to overfill, allow batter to spread out or you will have a mess to clean up. Browned up the waffles nicely."
5.0,"this is the second one of this waffle maker i had,, the first one was warn out, easy to use and 2 very good  recipes with it,, i have to be careful as how many i make as it seems they go right to my hips,,"
2.0,"I shouldโve read some more reviews before purchasing this. The whole unit feels cheaply made with the way the plates remain loose and did not stay snapped in place when I used it โฆ.it was also extremely hot, even when trying to use the plastic pieces to open it the steam scalded my fingers. I would not trust this unit anywhere near children because everything gets extremely hot!"
4.0,"I've used this for waffles, to heat my sandwiches for paninis and to cook turkey burgers on.  No complaints so far.  The plates are not dishwasher safe but I have had no problems washing them by hand.  It's a very simple waffle maker.  Two heating elements, one on top, one on bottom.  Little children should not be allowed to mess with this or they could get burnt.  When I made turkey burgers the liquid did not follow the trench for grease but slowly oozed off the side. That is partly the turkey burgers fault though.  It isn't a liquid but a white gooey mess that moves slow.  I have not tried any heavy grease items as yet.  My family likes the panini version even if it isn't marketed that way.  The waffles turned out nice.  Guess the missing 5th star is because when the plates arrived a little scuffing had taken place on the Teflon.  I am not a big user of Teflon coated material because it never sticks for long. No amount of very careful care will keep it from falling off either."
4.0,"I had one of these for many years which was used fairly often and it was great. It was losing it non stick properties and began taking longer to cook the waffles than it had before, so, I decided it was time for a new one. When it arrived, one of the removable griddle sections was jammed down into the outer body of the unit and was very difficult to extract. The metal in the outer shell is much thinner than the old unit I have used for years and the sides of the new unit had to be pressed back inwards to allow the griddle plates to sit (fit) properly. The new unit also has a problem with cooking uniformly...the back area, toward the hinge side, is much less done than the front half and I found it necessary to pull the waffle off, rotate it, and put it back in for a while to get even cooking. I have yet to determine what is causing this...could be the heating element or the thin outer shell is not allowing the heat to be evenly distributed. Perhaps I'll add more info in the future if I find the solution to the uneven cooking problem."
3.0,Works well but gets too Hot at outside the cooking spot.
