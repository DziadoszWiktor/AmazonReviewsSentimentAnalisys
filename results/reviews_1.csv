5.0,"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get."

5.0,"I read a lot of negative reviews about this phone and skipped the pre order, regrettably. Finally purchased this and have had the phone for a couple of months. It is amazing. Truly the screen colors are just fine coming from a Galaxy Edge 10. It's a beautiful phone. Smooth. So many options on this phone I couldn't use them all. Many options to make my life easier, grocery lists, Ai search for a family is a must. When the child says they want something on TV,  snap a Pic and search by phone later. This phone is a great option, don't let it overwhelm you if you're coming from a flip phone. You can use as little of the functionality of this phone as you are comfortable with and it will be there for all the high tech things you want to do. High res pictures is SPECTACULAR! Can't believe I took pictures of my family that were so blurry before, almost laughable. We'll no more! I would recommend this phone to all my friends and family even the iPhone user, this is way better."
5.0,I loved my Galaxy S9 Plus and replaced it with S24 Plus.  S24 Plus is lighter with a slightly larger screen and has a lot more features people talk about here.  Visibly the photos are of higher quality.  Battery lasts a lot longer.  It was so easy to transfer the data from my old phone.  I love it!
4.0,"I've only owned every version of the Note series (now Ultra) since Note 4 (did not own the bendy screen one, just regular). So this is old hat, you either love this phone for its S Pen or just go with something else. I use my phone and the pen to make grocery lists, to do lists, draw, edit photos, etc.Pros:-FLAT SCREEN IS BACK. HOLY COW, how I've hated those stupid curved edges, glad that flat is back. Just bring back MicroSD expansion as well. I would say bring back headphones but apparently Android 10 or later killed external mic support via the combo jack. So, that's useless. This was the MAJOR reason why I upgraded my S23 Ultra, no joke, now I can put actual screen protectors on it, don't have to worry about optical glue-on glass that you then cure with UV.Cons:-Love that you can't turn off really annoying unnecessary notifications like the DAILYWELLNESS nonsense, weekly usage reports, ""hey we turned these apps off since you're not using them"".-Love that the galaxy store now has push notification ads that you can't turn off in settings or in app. That's super cool. Save that crap for your GALAXY A lines that are budget oriented, not your professional S lines.-New S Pen, now most of the time, the S-Pens that come with these are SERVICEABLE at best, but for whatever reason, this year's is painful to use, could be old age kicking in at 36 or just a bad design. It's too thin and too square. Last year's was slightly wider. NEVER MIND, just compared them, they're basically the same, it's the fact that last years had a rubberized texture on it, where this year's is just plastic, that's why it hurts to use.Meh:-A lot of this is more the same incremental improvements; cpu is beefier, display is brighter and more betterer, s pen is faster, touch is faster, etc. THE BORING STUFF.Overall:You always take a gamble with Amazon's ""USED"" stuff, and was worried that I was going to get a bad one. I bought, USED VERY GOOD, which usually means cosmetic damage somewhere on the device, and then it was ""USED VERY GOOD, potentially without box"". Mine looked pristine, slapped a screen protector and case on it right away to keep it that way, and it came with a box. You buy this phone if Samsung and styluses are your jam. OTHERWISE there's no real reason to get this. When there are a lot of companies with the 8 Gen 3 out there for a lot cheaper and in smaller more manageable body sizes. Like the S23 Plus or S23 standard. The Titanium Gray color has a slight champagne/earthen quality to the gray that I kind of dig that's subtle and sort of classy."
5.0,What can I say the device is wonderful. I don't need a computer because it does everything a computer does and them some more features. I  love that I can call someone and for example speak English and the other person on the other like the AI translate to Spanish (for example). It edits my pictures. I love it comes with more storage space..
5.0,"i am a samsung-ite, so of course i have a bias going in this, i love the flat-screen, the size is great (i wish they would come out with an 8"" screen, i would love that) it is ok with me that they dropped the micro sd card slot (i subscribe to google-one with the 2TB plan) but whatever you do samsung, i beg you please DO NOT follow the iphone and drop the sim-card slot (this is critically important) the e-sim thing is fantastic, i noticed one extra hour of smartphone battery time (the 4900 miliamp vs the s23+ 4700) i get 7 hrs vs 6hrs (galaxy s23+)  but one great complaint, that thousands have complained about: ""the washed-out screen display) YES INDEED!!!! i compare for example the galaxy s23+ homescreen vs the galaxy s24+ homescreen, ANYONE WITH TWO WORKING EYEBALLS CAN SEE THIS VERY CLEARLY!!!, now i can live with this, but this is a MAJOR BIG DEAL!!!, and samsung supposedly did a software update to correct this??? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! FORGET IT, NO CHANGE WHATSOEVER!!! but as i say i am a samsung-guy so it wont kill me, BUT IT IS A BLACK-EYE AND I WILL REMEMBER THIS SAMSUNG!!!"
4.0,It is a very nice phone. It can do a lot. The zoom on the phone is incredible. The clarity of the screen is I feel pretty good. The quality of all the pictures is a little bit to be said. Do not get me wrong it takes some pretty darn good pictures. My biggest problem with the pictures is that it takes a great picture of the item that you're taking a picture of. But blurs out the background. The only other thing that I'm really kind of disappointed about. Is the volume as far as on the phone. Phone calls. Even on speaker phone. If you have any kind of noise around you you will not build to hear it. It can play media very loud And usually have to turn it down a little. If they would find a way to fix the volume on phone calls. That would be a plus.
4.0,"The first phone I ordered came in an open box when the description said new. When I called Amazon customer service they told me to inspect the phone and turn it on. When I turned it on, I discovered the phone is locked to Verizon and not unlocked like the description said.Customer service encouraged me to return the phone and reorder the same phone. They were unable to send a replacement which would been a much simpler solution for me. They were also unable to explain why they sent me a used product when I ordered a new phone.The second phone I ordered has lived up to my expectations, now I just have to hope I get my refund."
3.0,"The bad:Screen colors recently fixed so I upped the stars to 3Reception is middling (compared to my Note 20 Ultra it's a bit worse)Camera white balance is straight green/blue and images/video are just darkWide angle camera is not as wide as my Note 20 and no better qualityWhen on speakerphone, the top speaker cuts out if you get close to the top speaker.Generally jagged user experience due to a bunch of Samsung crap that cannot be removed.Bloody expensive for something that's delivered in this state.The meh:Batt life is good (not great, just good) only if run in 60hz and low power mode.In low power mode at 120hz the batt life is merely acceptable.All compared to my 3yr old note 20 in low power 60hz mode which is just below acceptable.The good:The antireflective coating on the screen is genuinely amazingThe 120hz on the screen is uber smooth but unfortunately hits the battThe rest is fine; not different from my Note 20 UltraThere's a thread on the Samsung forum that's thousands of posts long about these same issues I've brought up here. The screen color issue has been improved with a recent update (3/7/24)Hopefully all of the bad can be fixed with a software update but currently the phone is borderline unusable due to the extremely blue camera(s) white balance and lacking signal strength. I cannot understand how after ALL THIS TIME, Samsung seemingly doesn't test their flagship phone before manufacturing and shipping.As for the cameras, they're okay if the white balance wasn't green/blue and dark. My Note 20 from 3yrs ago takes nicer looking pictures but it's honestly difficult to tell if the cameras are any good because it's just so green/blue. If you edit each image one by one on an appropriate editor (not the built in one), you can get the images to look pretty good but a typical iphone 15 takes the same looking image without any editing. Reviewers are showing carefully shot images of scenes. General picture taking without much thought results in pretty bland/poor looking images you don't care to share. I really wish they would allow you to adjust at least the white balance settings in the camera app such that the images it takes are correct to what you desire by default.I don't know what to say about all the tech reviewers out there raving about this phone. Either they were given a completely different phone or they're all paid off. I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone until Samsung addresses the ridiculous issues. I do believe all but the signal issue can be fixed with an update but that would require Samsung to admit there's an issue and then address it which seems to be difficult for them to do. The signal issue may even be able to be improved with a radio update but again, Samsung needs to admit there's something wrong which they don't want to.I absolutely hate Apple due to their requirement for you to live in their ecosystem but this will likely be my last Android if Samsung or someone else can't get their act together on such an expensive product.On a very very positive note, the antireflective screen on this phone is genuinely incredible. It's the single biggest upgrade imaginable. Unfortunately putting any screen protector ruins that feature so I'm just going to use it without a screen protector. The phone is worth buying simply for the antireflection. It's THAT BIG of a difference. I cannot understand why this isn't getting more attention. The darn signal strength issue is the single biggest deal breaker and so unfortunate and annoying. It's about ~15% worse than my 3yr old Note 20."
5.0,"Signed up for galaxy s24+ on day of release. Was glad to step up from s21. One thing I miss is the micro SD card for additional storage. Having all storage embedded in the phone may increase performance; however, it also eliminates local storage upgrade options. Only real option is to use cloud storage if local storage grows too quickly.Really love the quality improvements for the camera!! Improved screen and slight screen increase from base to + models is a nice touch. I remain impressed with the screen.After months I am very happy with the s24+."
5.0,You will not be disappointed buying this item. Of course you'll need to loose a liver or leg because is expensive. But the phone works marvelous without any issues and with lots of memory. Some people may be disappointed of the phone getting hot but others be not. The hotness will not really cost any problems. I have a supercharger 45watts that quickly charges the phone and unexpectedly doesn't overheats the phone. The device has a long battery life. But hey... is your decision if you want this extremely expensive device but worth item to obtain.
4.0,I am very happy with the battery life and the charge quickness. the screen is bright and vivid. phone works as it is supposed to. I still don't like the fact that you don't get a charge block. it used to be an experience to purchase a smartphone. unboxing was have of the purchase. now they might as well send it in a zip-lock bag because you only get the phone and a cable. $1400+ I feel like Samsung has just charged me more money for less product. If you are like me and use the S pen daily then this is the phone for you but if not get the s24+ or just the s24. I got the s24 for my employees and they all love them good phones at a much nicer price point around $700.The battery life on this phone is bar none! I went about 56hrs without charging the other day and I was using it most of the time. I was taking video watching and editing videos. surfing for vday presents on line and talked to about 30 customers on the phone once I realized that I hadnt charged in two days and i still had 16% left I was blown away. My s22 ultra wouldnt even last the day and it would never super fast charge. this phone always charges fast about 38 mins to full from 5%.
5.0,"Estaba un poco escéptica, pedí este teléfono para regalo a mi hijo en su cumple 15, sin embargo, lo que él me dice es: Lo único es que la batería siente que no dura, se lleva el teléfono cargado y a mitad del día debe poner a cargar otra vez.  No dura todo un día cargado para ser un teléfono de alta gamaFunciona muy bien para Venezuela, él lo tiene con Movistar y funciona excelente."
5.0,"I can’t really give a reliable review about the product, except that it looked really really nice, it was a bit heavy for a phone, & I like some of the abilities it can do, the storage is really nice too, that’s my opinion, but I bought it for a friend & can’t really give any info besides what I have given already. I do apologize. But I give 5 star because it had arrived safe, on schedule & without any damage."
5.0,"Look are you finding yourself squinting at a menu? This telephone is big, easy to read, makes google maps easy to hear and see. All without a hearing aid or a magnifying glass; so get out your walker and get over to your computer and order this phone it makes life easy. So much easier for everything, banking, financial investments... communications great product...just do yourself a favor and get a defender otter case to go with it. Highly recommend. By the way your doctor will love you if you get the galaxy 6 watch with it...at least when I am dead the paramedics can look at my watch and confirm it!"
4.0,"I have a S24 Ultra Factory Unlocked I save my contacts  in the following format 1 area code 7digits.  For example +1 345 123 4567If I call a contact with 7digits (123 4567), I see their name. But when I hit dial only the number appears.  In my call logs it only shows the number.If I dial the contact using area code all is well.  I have removed and replaced contacts.  I have moved contacts from Google to phone and back.Software is up to date"
4.0,"Switching from my Note 10 Plus to the Samsung Ultra S24 was a big move for me. The new phone works a lot like my old one, and I could easily transfer all my stuff to it. I haven't really figured out the AI stuff yet, but the camera is good, and the battery lasts a long time. The phone is a bit heavy and thick, but I'm happy with its size overall."
5.0,"Love the phone so far. Switching back from a Motorola.  Sound is great, music is so much better,  fingerprint sensor is on the screen not on the side yeah. Pictures are just amazing and I haven't really taken many. It is easy to use"
4.0,"Please keep in mind if you are buying this phone to use it in the Liberty PR network, the group texting won't work. Everything else works fine."
5.0,"Sansung realmente se esforzó por hacer un buen celular, este lo tiene todo. La batería me dura hasta el final del día sin ningún problema. La camara es hermosa. El celular va muy fluido. Totalmente recomendado 😻 fan de Samsung"
5.0,"I'm very amazed by this phone I had the Galaxy. S20, This phone was a huge advancement over my old phone. I read some of the reviews and was a little bit worried but it is the absolute best phone i've ever had. I really like the styling. I have it in a case which covers it up nicely, and it wasn't extremely expensive, the phone was quite expensive, but oh well. Figure I might not live forever so why not enjoy life a little and have the toys I want.If you got the bucks for this, get it and get the biggest memory that you could afford.  I took these pictures with the solar viewing glasses. And then the ones where the sun is a ring around the moon were without anything in front of the camera. I had the phone on a tripod. And I used voice command to make it, take the pictures. It really did amazing taking pictures of the eclipse. I really love the stylus pen it is going to be very handy."
5.0,"Very good. Daughter was very excited about it.Package intact. Only downside of this new Samsung, generally speaking, is the fact the model is missing a extra slot for a memory card. I know 256GB memory sound a lot, but in reality is not. Maybe Samsung will amend this for the future.....Quite good overall!"
5.0,"What can I say?? Beautiful piece of a phone...I'm still learning my way around my phone....it's much better than my Note 10+. Pix come out some much clearer. I happened to find an app thar allows my home screen to change n the background, which I couldn't find on my Note 10+ and I think is pretty awful. Love the different customizations that I can do too."
5.0,"Love, so far. I love the fingerprint sensor.  Many great features over what my s20+ had. I gave my s20 to my wife to replace her old s10 which wasn't 5g or wifi6 compatible."
5.0,C'mon Apple users.. you guys have no idea what's a great and most advanced phone in the WORLD! NO IDEA!This thing BLOWS out of the water any Apple phone product.. ha!Enough said!
5.0,"I love this phone, the camera is great, the only issue I really have is the battery goes dead too fast but not really a big issue all in all it's the best phone I've ever had"
3.0,"Buying Samsung products is not inexpensive. With cell phones, however, one expects quality - especially as pricey as their phones are.My pro: the phone feels sturdy and comfortable in hand.My Cons:  1.  The secondary sim is an e-sim, which is not accommodated by all cell service providers.  2.  Most user choices are removed with this phone and unable to be changed in settings. Example - If you use an eSim with a physical sim, the physical sim settings are primary OVER eSim settings. This is even when the eSim is designated as the primary sim. All eSim settings are treated as secondary.  3.  Google accounts on the phone cannot be selected as primary or secondary. The phone forces the selection on users whether or not you want them that way. Example - I have a personal (for purposes of android) and work based email that each use Google. The physical sim attached to my work email / account is treated as primary OVER my personal account. Well, geez, it's my phone that I spent an enormous amount of money on.  4.  While different ringtones and notification settings are selected for each sim, AGAIN, they settings for the physical sim supersede those for the eSim.  5.  Many apps on your phone will default to the Samsung selected settings are unable to be changed.  6.  Privacy controls are NOT user editable.  Most privacy issues must be waved for use of the phone.There are many more gripes or dislikes about this phone. Bottom line, user control or preferences are removed. Further, if you use this phone to travel, wherein most users may opt to use a physical sim purchased in the respective country of travel, then expect that all settings for that physical sim will override ANY setting used for the eSim, EVEN WHEN the eSim is selected as primary.  NOT OKAY!!Samsung has already removed so many standard features from their phones such as the sd card, earphone jacks, and other things.  This is all done (seemingly) to compete with Apple.  What Samsung hasn't grasped is that Android users are not trying to be Apple users. Users selected or stayed with Android for a reason. Second, while Apple seemingly goes to great lengths to protect users privacy concerns, Samsung causes users to wave them, especially if the user wants to take advantage of their bloatware or apps.  For all these sacrifices, Samsung could have retained two things -  the use of TWO physical sim cards versus an eSim and physical and user control over their data."
5.0,Needed to replace my Note 9 due to it being run over by a vehicle in a parking lot. Very happy with the S24 Ultra so far. I better be with the price tag of these new phones now. The battery lasts a lot longer than the Note 9 battery ever did. I am happy so far. Also I am now using a belt attached pouch to hold the phone now due to the price of these phones. My Note 9 became detached from a Otterbox belt clip while loading material at a local big box store. Evidently the belt clip attachment was probably getting too worn to hold the phone securely.
4.0,"phone worked fine , too big, and the design a little outdated , I decided to return it , the return experience with amazon has been really bad , they did not acknowledge they had received the item and they did not refund until 45 days after item was shipped back. really very bad experience overall"
